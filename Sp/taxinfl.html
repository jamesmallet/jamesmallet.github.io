<hr width="100%"></h2><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif">Taxonomic

inflation is the rapid accumulation of scientific names due to

processes other than new discoveries of taxa. The main processes are

"splitting", elevation of taxa to a higher level (creating inflation at

the higher level) or taxonomic error of some sort.&nbsp; For a report

on the effect of the phylogenetic species concept (PSC) on taxonomic

inflation, and its implications for biodiversity studies, conservation

and

macroecology, see:<br>

<b><font color="#006600">1) Inflation of species due to taxonomic error (overdescription)</font></b><br>

<br>

Used by John Alroy in: Taxonomic inflation and body mass distributions

in north american fossil mammals.&nbsp; Journal of Mammalogy,

84(2):431-443, 2003.&nbsp; Available at:<br>

<br>

<a href="http://www.nceas.ucsb.edu/%7Ealroy/pdfs/2003-JMamm-84-431.pdf">http://www.nceas.ucsb.edu/~alroy/pdfs/2003-JMamm-84-431.pdf</a><br>

<br>

N.B. This is the only use of the phrase that came up using Web of

Knowledge/ISI (but see earlier scientific journal uses below).&nbsp;

Intriguing use of a dynamic equilbrium model (proposal vs.

synonymization) to estimate equilibrium value of the numbers of

species.&nbsp; He doesn't mention any recent upsurge in the numbers of

species considered valid (c.f. use 3), which perhaps has not happened

to the fossil taxa with which he is dealing.<br>

<br>

See also somewhat similar use of taxonomic inflation via synonymy by P. Venu (2002), in "Current Science": <a href="http://www.ias.ac.in/currsci/apr252002/924.pdf">http://www.ias.ac.in/currsci/apr252002/924.pdf</a><br>

<br>

Another paper in the same journal critiques the "biodiversity hotspot"

for herpetofauna in Sri Lanka, and argues that this is due to

overdescription, particularly via molecular data: <br>

<b><font color="#006600">2) Inflation of rank to higher categories in systematics = taxonomic elevation</font></b><br>

<br>

See:&nbsp; Alex Kaslev and Toby White's "Palaeos" site.<br>

<br>

e.g. "Take the example of the brachiopod family [sic] Cranioidea (a

type of marine shelled invertebrate).&nbsp; As these animals are quite

distinct from other members of the phylum Brachiopoda they were given

their own superfamily Cranioidea.&nbsp; This then became a distinct

order - Craniida.&nbsp; Okay, fair enough.&nbsp; But then in a more

recent classification they have been raised to the rank of class, the

Craniata (containing the Craniida and two other orders, the Craniopsida

and Trimerellida) and even a sub-phylum Craniiformea.&nbsp; Many other

examples can be given, such as classes of micro-organisms (Protista)

raised to kingdom and superkingdom rank!"<br>

<b><font color="#006600">3) Explosion of names due to splitting</font></b><br>

<br>

Somewhat overlaps with above usage, because taxonomic elevation, sense

(2), almost always leads to taxonomic inflation in sense (3).<br>

<br>
See: DJ Patterson 1999. The diversity of eukaryotes.&nbsp; Amer. Nat. 65, supplement: 
S96-S124.&nbsp; <br>

<br>

p. S99: "Ranks and Hierarchy<br>

The past 30 yr have seen a proliferation of phyla and kingdoms largely

among the protists. In 1964, the Society of Protozoologists created a

scheme of classification with a single phylum of protozoa (Honigberg et

al. 1964). More recent classification schemes that use ranks contain

dozens of phyla (e.g., Corliss 1984; Cavalier-Smith 1998) within a

variable number of kingdoms. This **taxonomic inflation** and the use

of different ranks in a short space of time is disquieting."<br>

<br>

See also: Cox, C. Barry 2001.&nbsp; The biogeographic regions reconsidered.&nbsp; Journal of Biogeography, 28, 511-523.<br>

<br>

p. 517: "A more plausible possibility is that the taxonomic diversity

of the Holarctic Kingdom has been artificially inflated. ... The low

diversity of the angiosperm flora of the Holarctic Kingdom might well

also have tempted the many northern hemisphere botanists to raise the

taxonomic rank of the taxa they studied, while the greater diversity of

the taxa in the tropics might well have discouraged such a tendency.

The suggestion that there may have been **taxonomic inflation** in

Takhtajan's data base for the Holarctic Kingdom is supported by

comparison of his figures for endemic families with those derived from

Heywood's (1978) atlas (compare columns 1 and 3 in Table 1). Although

in most of the Kingdoms Heywood's figures are half those of Takhtajan,

in the Holarctic Kingdom they are only one quarter those of Takhtajan.

All of these observations support the view that the high figure for

endemic genera (and therefore also for percentage endemicity) in the

Holarctic Kingdom is a taxonomic artefact."<br>

<br>
See also usage by Ken Kinman discussing the explosion of higher taxa of protists, 
somewhat overlapping with (2) above, because both types of taxonomic inflation 
can be due to the same nomenclatural acts.&nbsp; (Used to be at: <a href="http://www.cmnh.org/dinoarch/2001Mar/msg00064.html">http://www.cmnh.org/dinoarch/2001Mar/msg00064.html</a>)<br>

<br>
There is also a slightly different sense of taxonomic inflation by Niklas Wahlberg 
for oversplitting of butterfly genera.&nbsp; See: <a href="http://www.helsinki.fi/science/metapop/phylogeny.html">http://www.lepsys.eu</a><br>

<br>

I would say that this meaning (3) has a long informal history and would

be the meaning triggered in most butterfly systematists like Niklas

Wahlberg, for example, who argues that overzealous application of

incorrect phylogenetic assumptions is at the root of the problem.&nbsp;

I think it is also more or less what we mean in Isaac et al. 2004, only

we mean it at the species level.<br>
