<p>SPECIES ARE CRUCIAL IN MANY BIODIVERSITY ISSUES: much of conservation,
biodiversity studies, ecology, and legislation concerns this taxonomic
level. It may therefore seem rather surprising that biologists have failed
to agree on a single species concept. The disagreement means that species
counts could easily differ by an order of magnitude or more when the same
data is examined by different taxonomies. This article explores the controversy
on species concepts and its implications for evolution and conservation.
<p>I. What are species concepts for?
<p>Individual organisms can usually be recognized, but the larger units
we use to describe the diversity of life, such as populations, subspecies,
or species are not so easily identifiable. Taxonomists further group species
into genera, families, orders, and kingdoms etc., while ecologists group
species into higher structures such as communities and ecosystems. The
justification for these group terms is utility, rather than intrinsic naturalness,
but as far as possible we attempt to delimit groups of organisms along
natural fault lines, so that approximately the same groupings can be recovered
by independent observers. However there will be a virtually infinite number
of different, albeit nested, ways of classifying the same organisms, given
that life has evolved hierarchically.
<p>Darwin (1859) felt that species were similar in kind to groupings at
lower and higher taxonomic levels; in contrast, most recent authors suggest
that species are more objectively identifiable, and thus more "real" than,
say, populations or genera. Much of ecology and biodiversity today appears
to depend on the idea that the species is the fundamental taxon, and these
fields could be undermined if, say, genera, or subspecies had the same
logical status.
<p>Species concepts originate in taxonomy, where the species is "the basic
rank of classification" according to the International Commission of Zoological
Nomenclature. The main use of species in taxonomy and derivative sciences
is to order and retrieve information on individual specimens in collections
or data banks. In evolution, we would like to delimit a particular kind
of evolution, speciation, which produces a result qualitatively different
from within-population evolution, although it may of course involve the
same processes. In ecology, the species is a group of individuals within
which variation can often be ignored for the purposes of studying local
populations or communities, so that species can compete, for example, while
subspecies or genera are not usually considered in this light. In biodiversity
and conservation studies, and in environmental legislation, species are
important as units which we would like to be able to count both regionally
or globally.
<p>It would be enormously helpful if a single definition of species could
satisfy all these uses, but a generally accepted definition has yet to
be found, and indeed is believed by some to be an impossibility. A unitary
definition should be possible, however, if species are "real", objectively
definable and fundamental biological units. Conversely, even if species
have no greater objectivity than other taxa, unitary nominalistic guidelines
for definining species might still be found, perhaps after much diplomacy,
via international agreement among biologists; after all, if we can adopt
metres and kilograms, we should be able to agree on units of biodiversity
in a similar way. In either case, knowledge of the full gamut of today's
competing solutions to the species concept problem will probably be necessary
for a universal species definition to be found. This article reviews the
proposals currently on the table, and their usefulness in ecology, evolution,
and conservation.
<p>II. Statement of bias
<p>I am of the opinion that the "reality" of species in evolution, and
in ecological and biodiversity studies over large areas has been overestimated.
In contrast, it is clear to any naturalist that species are usually somewhat
objectively definable in local communities. It is my belief that confusion
over species concepts has been caused by scientists not only attempting
to extend this local objectivity of species over space and evolutionary
time, but also arguing fruitlessly among themselves as to the nature of
the important reality that underlies this illusory spatiotemporal objectivity.
To me, agreement on a unified species-level taxonomy is possible, but will
be forthcoming only if we accept that species lack a single, interpretable
biological reality over their geographic range and across geological time.
<p>Just as Marxist theory may be wrong, yet remains a convenient tool for
studying political history, I hope that my own views can provide, even
for the skeptic, a useful framework on which the history of proposals for
species concepts can be compared. A variety of other outlooks can be found
in Mayr (1982), Cracraft (1989), Ridley (1996), Claridge et al. (1997)
and Howard &amp; Berlocher (1998).
<p>III. Darwinian species criteria
<p>A. Darwin's morphological species criterion
<p>Before Darwin, it was often assumed that each species had an Aristotelian
"form" or "essence", and that variation within a species was due to imperfections
in the actualization of this form. Each individual species was defined
by its essence, which itself was unvarying and inherently different from
all other species essences. This mode of thought of course precluded transformation
of one species into another, and was associated with belief that each form
was separately created by God. Darwin's extensive travels and knowledge
of taxonomy led to a realization that the distinction between intraspecific
and interspecific variation was false. His abandonment of the essentialist
philosophy and its species concept went hand in hand with his appreciation
that variation itself was among the most important characteristics of living
organisms, because it was this variation which allowed species to evolve.
<p>Darwin guessed (correctly) that essentialist species would be hard to
give up: <i>"... we shall have to treat species in the same manner as those
naturalists treat genera, who admit that genera are merely artificial combinations
made for convenience. This may not be a cheering prospect; but we shall
at least be freed from the vain search for the undiscovered and undiscoverable
essence of the term species."</i> (Darwin 1859: 485). He argued that species
were little more than varieties which acquired their claim to a greater
reality only when intermediates died out leaving a morphological gap: <i>"...
I believe that species come to be tolerably well-defined objects, and do
not at any one period present an inextricable chaos of varying and intermediate
links"</i> (Darwin 1859: 177). This morphological gap criterion, which
seems to have been accepted by most early evolutionists (e.g. Wallace 1865,
Robson 1928), has been called a "morphological species concept" because
Darwin used the gaps in morphology to delimit species; however, it would
be easy to extend his species criterion to ecology, behaviour, or genetic
(see VIII D below).
<p>B. Polytypic species
<p>A major revolution in zoological taxonomy occurred around 1900. As the
great museum collections became more complete, it became obvious that apparently
distinct species found in different areas frequently intergraded where
they overlapped. These replacement species were usually combined as subspecies
within a "polytypic" species (see SUBSPECIES, SEMISPECIES, SUPERSPECIES),
an idea suggested for "geographical varieties" by early systematists and
Darwinists such as Wallace (1865). The taxonomic clarification that followed,
which allowed identifiable geographic varieties to be named below the species
level as subspecies, was conceptually more or less complete by the 1920s
and 1930s. At the same time, other infraspecific animal taxa such as local
varieties or forms were deemed unnameable in the Linnean taxonomy. These
changes are now incorporated into the International Code of Zoological
Nomenclature (see also SUBSPECIES, SEMISPECIES, SUPERSPECIES). Similar
ideas were promoted in botany by G.L. Stebbins (see Mayr 1982), although
local varieties and polymorphic forms remain valid and nameable taxa in
the International Botanical Code.
<p>IV. The philosophization of species, the "interbreeding" concept.
<p>In January 1904, E.B. Poulton read his famous presidential address -
"What is a species?" - to the Entomological Society in London. Following
up some ideas raised (but immediately dismissed) by Wallace (1865), Poulton
proposed "syngamy" (i.e. interbreeding) as the true meaning of species.
Poulton and Wallace were both particularly knowledgeable about swallowtail
butterflies (Papilionidae). In swallowtails, there were strong sexual dimorphisms:
the female colour pattern often mimicks unrelated unpalatable butterflies
while the male is non-mimetic. The females themselves are often polymorphic,
each female form mimicking a different distasteful model. Under a morphological
criterion each form could be designated as a different species, whereas
mating observations in the wild showed that they were part of the same
interbreeding group. Similar ideas were promoted by the botanist J.P. Lotsy,
who termed the interbreeding species a "syngameon". In the 1930s T. Dobzhansky
studied morphologically indistinguishable sibling species of <i>Drosophila</i>
fruit-flies and concluded that Lotsy's approach had some value. A species
will rarely if ever interbreed with its sibling; each chooses mates from
within its own species. Dobzhansky proposed his own interbreeding species
concept, later popularized by Mayr as the "biological species concept",
so named because interbreeding was considered the single true biological
meaning, or reality of the term species (reviewed by Mayr 1970, 1982).
<p>A short definition of the biological species concept is: <i>"Species
are groups of interbreeding natural populations that are reproductively
isolated from other such groups"</i> (Mayr 1970). This concept was not
so much new as a clarification of two distinct threads: (1) a local component,
the Poulton/Dobzhansky interbreeding concept, and (2) a global component
which extended the interbreeding concept to cover geographical replacement
series of actually or potentially interbreeding subspecies (Mayr 1970),
as in the pre-existing idea of polytypic species (see also SUBSPECIES,
SEMISPECIES, SUPERSPECIES).
<p>This extended interbreeding concept was, until recently, almost universally
adopted by evolutionists. The species concept problem appeared to have
been solved; species were interbreeding communities, each of which formed
a gene pool reproductively incompatible with other such communities. The
new concept answered both perceived problems of Darwin's morphological
approach: (1) that under morphological criteria, distinct mutants and polymorphic
variants within populations might be considered separate species, and (2)
that sibling species might be misclassified morphologically as members
of the same species. The new approach was promoted in a long series of
books and articles by Dobzhansky, Mayr, and their followers. Mayr in particular
was highly influential by justifying the taxonomic application of the polytypic
species criteria in terms of the new concept of gene flow.
<p>In order to adopt this change, it was necessary to see species in a
new post-Darwinian light. Instead of species being defined simply, using
man-made criteria based on demonstrable characters such as morphology,
species became defined by characteristics important in their own maintenance,
that is by means of their biological function (Mayr 1982). Significantly,
the philosophical term "concept" came into vogue along with these ideas
about species, and that the term "species problem", which hitherto referred
to the problem of how species arose (Robson 1928), became instead the problem
of defining what species were. The important features of species defined
by the "biological concept" were that they were protected from gene flow
by what Dobzhansky termed "isolating mechanisms", including prezygotic
factors (ecological, mate choice and fertilization incompatibilities) and
postzygotic factors (hybrid inviability and sterility caused by genomic
incompatibilities). By going beyond simple character-based identification
of species, the concept could not apply to all living things; for example,
Dobzhansky simply concluded that asexuals (between which no interbreeding
is possible) could not have species.
<p>Poulton, Mayr and Dobzhansky emphasized that their new concept was based
on the reality that underlay species, rather than being merely a criterion
useful in taxonomy; in this new philosophical approach, taxonomic criteria
and conceptual issues of species became separate, with taxonomic criteria
taking a more minor role. The concept was true from first principles, and
was therefore untestable: difficulties such as hybridization, intermediates,
or inapplicability to many plants and asexuals caused taxonomic problems,
but did not disprove or even challenge the underlying truth of the concept.
These imperfect actualizations of species' true reality were expected in
nature. Mayr claimed that the biological concept would do away with "typology"
(his term for species definitions based on a fixed, unvarying type or Aristotelian
essence), but in many ways it can be seen that the biological concept reverts
to a new kind of essentialism, where evolutionary maintenance via interbreeding
is the underlying reality or essence of species.
<p>V. Alternative species concepts
<p>It is interesting that exactly this kind of search for the essence of
species had been criticized by Darwin (1859). In his chapter "Hybridism",
he specifically argued against using hybrid sterility and zygote inviability
as a cut and dried characteristic of species (although he made little mention
of pre-mating factors). Oddly, Mayr (1982:269) claimed both that Darwin
treated species "purely typologically [i.e. as an essentialist] as characterized
by degree of difference", and also that Darwin "had strong, even though
perhaps unconscious, motivation ... to demonstrate that species lack the
constancy and distinctiveness claimed for them by the creationists." Whether
it is reasonable to criticise Darwin in such a contradictory way can be
debated, but it is clear that Mayr's proposition that interbreeding is
the true essence or reality of species immediately laid itself open to
debate. Although the interbreeding concept had a long run (and still does),
proposals for different kinds of biological reality of species were eventually
forthcoming. By proposing a single reality for species, Poulton, Dobzhansky,
and Mayr opened the Pandora's box of alternative essences deemed more important
by other biologists.
<p>A. Ecological species concept
<p>Asexual organisms such as the bdelloid rotifers can clearly be clustered
into groups recognizable as taxonomic species (Hutchinson 1968). On the
other hand, distinct forms such as oaks (<i>Quercus</i>), between which
there are high rates of hybridization, can remain recognizably distinct
even where they co-occur. This suggested to L. van Valen and others that
the true meaning of species was occupancy of an ecological niche rather
than interbreeding. This ecological idea became known as the "ecological
species concept". It became clear to Mayr during the 1970s also (see Mayr
1982) that gene flow could not unite every population in a polytypic, biological
species' range, and that stabilization of phenotype might be effected by
ecologically mediated stabilizing selection (see also VII B and VIII B
below) rather than purely because of gene flow.
<p>B. Recognition concept of species
<p>An important attack on the biological species concept came from H.E.H.
Paterson in the early 1980s. His claims were twofold: first, the Dobzhansky/Mayr
term "isolating mechanisms" implied reproductive isolation was adaptive,
which Paterson felt was unlikely; second, the true reality underlying species
was proposed to be prezygotic compatibility, consisting of mating signals
and fertilization signals. According to Paterson (1985), this compatibility
is strongly conserved by stabilizing selection, whereas isolating mechanisms
such as hybrid sterility or inviability are non-adaptive and can be argued
to be a result rather than a cause of species separateness. To Paterson
the true reality of species must be adaptive. He termed his idea of species
the "recognition concept" versus Mayr's "isolation concept", and its important
characteristics "specific mate recognition systems" (SMRS) instead of isolating
mechanisms. Species were defined as "<i>that most inclusive population
of individual biparental organisms which share a common fertilization system</i>"
(Paterson 1985).
<p>The idea is generally recognized as a useful critique and has gained
strong currency in some circles. However, it has been pointed out that
SMRS are more or less the inverse of prezygotic isolating mechanisms, and
that the recognition concept therefore differs from the biological species
concept mainly by focussing on a subset of isolating mechanisms used within
the interbreeding concept. The interbreeding concept had always stressed
a common gene pool and compatibility within a species, as well as isolation
between species.
<p>VI. Species concepts based on history
<p>A. Monophyly
<p>The rise of cladistic methods revolutionised systematics by proposing
that all classification should be based on the idea of monophyly. This
new system formalized the principle that paraphyletic and polyphyletic
taxa were unnatural groupings which should not be used in taxonomy. It
was natural to attempt to apply this idea throughout systematics, all the
way down to the species level, leading to a monophyly criterion of species,
a type of "phylogenetic species concept" (Hennig 1968, see also the diagnostic
definition below). Species were seen as forming when a single interbreeding
population split into two branches or lineages that did not exchange genetic
material. In a somewhat different formulation, the "cladistic species concept",
species are branch segments in the phylogeny, with every branching event
leading to a new pair of species (Ridley 1996). Otherwise, if only one
of the two branches were recognized as new, the other branch would become
paraphyletic.
<p>Perhaps the main criticism of this idea is that it could, if applied
in taxonomy, cause great nomenclatural instability. Monophyly exhibits
fractal self-similarity and can exist at very high or very low levels of
the phylogeny, so the precise level at which species taxa exist becomes
unclear. Supposing a new monophyletic form is discovered overlapping with,
but remaining distinct from, a closely related local form in the terminal
branches of an existing species. Recognition of this taxon as a species
would leave the remaining branches within the original species paraphyletic.
Many other branch segments would then need to be recognized at the species
level, even if they interbreed and have reticulate, intermingling phylogenies.
Many phylogenetic systematists therefore adopt a different phylogenetic
concept, the diagnostic concept (see below), which can allow paraphyly
at the species level.
<p>B. Genealogy
<p>Another problem with a monophyly concept is that a single, true phylogeny
of taxa may rarely exist: an organismal phylogeny is in fact an abstraction
of the actual genetic history, consisting of multiple gene genealogies,
some of which may undergo genetic exchange with other taxa. There is now
good evidence that occasional horizontal gene transfer and hybridization
may selectively transfer genetic material between unrelated forms. Furthermore
there are multiple gene lineages within any population, so that, if such
a population were to become geographically or genetically split into two
distinct forms, it would be some time before each branch became fixed for
different, reciprocally monophyletic gene lineages at any single gene.
The idea of monophyly for whole genomes then becomes hard to define, especially
near the species boundary. However annoying, phylogenetic methods and evolutionary
theory must face up to these facts (Avise &amp; Ball 1990, Maddison 1997).
It has therefore been suggested that species should be defined when a consensus
between multiple gene genealogies indicates reciprocal monophyly. This
is called the "genealogical species concept" (Baum &amp; Shaw 1995).
<p>Critics argue that this idea has many problems in common with other
monophyly concepts of species (Davis 1997). Geographic forms that have
become isolated in small populations or on islands, say, could rapidly
become fixed for gene lineages, and become viewed as separate species without
any biologically important evolution taking place. On the other hand, clearly
distinct sister taxa such as humans and chimpanzees still share gene genealogy
polymorphisms at some genes such as the HLA complex involved in immunological
defence, and might therefore be classified as the same species under genealogical
considerations.
<p>C. Diagnostic species concept
<p>The motivation for the diagnostic concept, usually called the "phylogenetic
species concept" by its adherents, was again to incorporate phylogenetic
Hennigian thinking into species-level taxonomy. There are many cases of
hybridization between taxa on very different branches of species level
phylogenies, which suggests that interbreeding and phylogeneticrealities
conflict. Cracraft (1989) also noted that many bird taxa normally though
of as subspecies were far more recognizable and stable nomenclaturally
than the polytypic species to which they supposedly belonged (see also
VIII D below). Cracraft therefore argued that the polytypic/interbreeding
species concept should be rejected, and in its place we should use a diagnostic
criterion in the form of at least one fixed difference at some inherited
character. "<i>A phylogenetic species is an irreducible (basal) cluster
of organisms, diagnosably distinct from other such clusters, and within
which there is a parental pattern of ancestry and descent</i>" (Cracraft
1989). According to Cracraft, species defined in this way are the proper
basal, real taxa suitable for phylogenetic analysis and evolutionary studies.
<p>Of course, if diagnostic criteria are applied strictly, rather small
groups of individuals, or even single specimens might be defined as separate
species. Cracraft recognized this and argued that such diagnosable groups
have no <i>"parental pattern of ancestry and descent</i>", i.e. they are
not proper populations. However, this qualification appears similar to
an interbreeding criterion of species, whereas the whole approach of using
diagnostic characters was an attempt to get away from interbreeding.
<p>Most evolutionary biologists balk at the idea of speciation being merely
the acquisition of a new geographic diagnostic character, a DNA base pair
or colour pattern change perhaps (Harrison 1998). "Speciation" is only
a different, or special kind of evolution if the new "species" is a distinct
population which can coexist locally with its sibling or parent population
without losing its integrity.
<p>Characters used to diagnose phylogenetic species may not be shared derived
characters; they may be primitive (plesiomorphic) characters, or they may
have evolved several times. Therefore, phylogenetic species need not be
monophyletic, and could presumably be paraphyletic and perhaps polyphyletic.
Cracraft appears confused on this matter: on the one hand he claims that
phylogenetic species <i>"will never be non-monophyletic, except through
error"</i> (Cracraft 1989: 35), but on the other recognizes that
<i>"their
historical status may [sometimes] be unresolved because relative to their
sister species they are primitive in all respects. Whether they ... [are]
truly paraphyletic ... is probably unresolvable"</i> (Cracraft 1989: 35).
It seems odd to allow a "phylogenetic" species to be even paraphyletic
(let alone polyphyletic) because paraphyly contravenes one of the basic
tenets of phylogenetic systematics, and because one of the main justifications
for a phylogenetic species concept is that species defined via other concepts
might sometimes be paraphyletic: "<i>The biological species concept cannot
be applied to the </i>Thomomys umbrinus<i> complex unless one is willing
to accept paraphyletic species, and do do so would be a de facto admission
that biological species are not units of evolution"</i> (Cracraft 1989:
46; see also Davis 1997: 374). The phylogeneticists' resolution of that
problem, using diagnostic characters, leads to the same difficulty all
over again! This rather glaring logical inconsistency considerably undercuts
the argument for a diagnostic species concept.
<p>In spite of these problems, Cracraft highlighted some genuine practical
problems with the polytypic application of the interbreeding concept, and
as a result this phylogenetic species concept has been influential. Ornithologists
in particular have used diagnostic characters to reassign many taxa long
thought of as subspecies to the level of full species. Recently many molecular
systematists, including botanists (Davis 1997) have taken up Cracraft's
suggestion and used diagnostic differences between populations, in some
cases at single DNA base pairs, as evidence that two forms are separate
species even if they intergrade freely at the boundaries of their distribution.
<p>VII. Combined species concepts
<p>A. Evolutionary and lineage concepts
<p>Faced with the problem of studying the evolution of species through
time, the palaeontologist G.G. Simpson (1951) proposed his "evolutionary
species concept", in which a species is "<i>a lineage (an ancestral-descendant
sequence of populations) evolving separately from others and with its own
unitary evolutionary role and tendencies</i>". In other words, Simpson
combined the idea that species were historical lineages with the concept
of their evolutionary and ecological role. The key essence here appears
to be "evolutionary independence". This concept appeals to phylogenetic
systematists and palaeontologists alike, because of its historical dimension,
and to neontologists because of its acknowledgement that biological mechanisms
are what make the species real. De Queiroz (1998) is perhaps the most recent
reviewer to propose that a single concept, which he calls "the general
lineage concept", under which "<i>species are segments of population-level
lineages"</i>, underlies all other species concepts. According to De Queiroz,
apparently competing species concepts merely emphasize different characters
or criteria for species definition, but all acknowledge implicitly or explicitly
that evolutionary separateness of lineage is the primary concept. This
is a nice ideal, but evolutionary independence has little logical force
in its application to actual forms that hybridize or undergo genetic exchange.
<p>B. Cohesion concept of species
<p>In similar vein, Templeton's (1998) "cohesion concept" fuses a number
of competing ideas of species. Templeton argues that a combination of ecological
and reproductive cohesion are important for maintaining a species' evolutionary
unity and integrity, thereby incorporating components of the evolutionary,
ecological, recognition, and interbreeding concepts. As well as applying
to asexual taxa ("too little sex"), Templeton's idea also applied to species
like oaks that undergo frequent hybridization and gene flow ("too much
sex" for the interbreeding concepts). He further argues that separateness
of genealogy is another important characteristic of species.
<p>We are perhaps nearing the apogee of the species debate with these combined
concepts. By incorporating evolutionary and phylogenetic origins together
with every possible biological means by which species are currently maintained,
these combined concepts "cover all the bases". One can acknowledge that
species evolve and are maintained as cohesive wholes by all of these multifarious
processes, yet at the same time argue that species can, and perhaps should
be seen as separate from their histories of origin and from current reasons
for their integrity. If groups with very different and conflicting biological
and evolutionary characteristics are all considered species, there should
exist a simpler criterion that unites them. It can also be argued that
to conflate the origin and evolutionary role of a taxon with the definition
of that taxon itself may lead to circularity, particularly in conservation
or ecological studies, or when investigating speciation.
<p>VIII. Dissent: maybe species are not real.
<p>Throughout the history of the species debate, starting with Darwin,
there have been some who argue that species are not individual "real" objects,
but should instead be considered merely as man-made constructs merely useful
in understanding of biodiversity and its evolution. These people are not
necessarily nihilists, who deny that species exist: they simply argue that
actual morphological and genetic gaps between populations would be more
useful for delimiting species than inferred processes underlying evolution
or maintenance of these gaps. By their refusal to unite these ideas under
a single named concept, this biologist "silent majority" have rarely found
a common voice.
<p>A. Taxonomic practice
<p>Taxonomists are on the front line of the species battle, because it
is they who ultimately decide whether to lump or split taxa, and at what
level to name them as species. If the objectivity and individuality of
species as the primary taxon exists, taxonomists' activities have not been
made any easier; and many taxonomists have simply ignored or denied belief
in the evolutionary reality of species. In general it is probably true
to say that at least 10% of taxonomic species are subject to revision because
of these practical difficulties in delimitation.
<p>For this reason, since the rise of the polytypic/interbreeding species
concept, there has been little impact of the post-war species concepts
on practising taxonomists, even while the debate raged around them. Procedure,
at least in zoology, was more or less as follows: geographic variants which
blended (or were thought to be able to blend) together at their boundaries
were united within a single, polytypic species, unless morphological or
genetic differences were so great that it seemed necessary to recognize
two species. On the other hand, whenever two divergent forms differing
at several unrelated traits, overlapped spatially, they were recognized
as separate species even if a few intermediates suggested some hybridization
or gene flow. Some taxonomists regarded subspecies as artificial taxa to
be avoided, and may either have ignored geographic variation, or elevated
subspecies of polytypic species to the rank of full species. But good taxonomic
practice on species remained broadly similar across most branches of systematics,
and involved careful analysis of multiple, chiefly morphological character
sets tested in large samples of specimens collected from as many geographic
regions as possible.
<p>This view on species and subspecies has led in zoology to a steady reduction
in the numbers of recognized species, as more and more dubiously separated
taxa, previously ranked as species, became inserted as subspecies into
larger and larger polytypic species. Recently, however, the diagnostic
version of the phylogenetic species concept (VI C above) has been making
strong inroads into zoological nomenclature, with the result is that counts
of species on continents are again climbing as former subspecies are re-elevated
to the species level, in spite of intergradation at their boundaries. However,
the situation could get much worse; many <i>Heliconius</i> butterflies,
for example, have over thirty geographic subspecies per species, all of
which can be diagnosed easily. The numbers of bird and butterfly species
could easily increase 2x - 10x in some groups if the diagnostic criterion
were generally adopted. The one reality that is clear in species-level
taxonomy is that the species is not real enough to remain at the same phylogenetic
level while taxonomic fashions change. There is good evidence that actual
species have been and still are purely man-made taxonomic units lacking
in any objectively determinable underlying essence, even if such an essence
exists.
<p>B. Populations are evolutionary units, not species
<p>Botanists deal with geographically variable organisms with low powers
of dispersal, and have therefore never been very happy with the polytypic/interbreeding
concept applied with such apparent success in zoology. Meanwhile, the strong
surge in experimental population genetics and evolutionary studies that
followed the books by Dobzhansky, Mayr and Stebbins has led to a greatly
improved understanding of gene flow in natural populations. Gene flow in
quite mobile animals, such as birds or butterflies, may not unite even
adjacent local populations in a common gene pool. If local populations
only rarely exchange genes, then gene flow across the range of a continental
species is clearly insufficient to explain species integrity, because it
would be outweighed easily by weak local patterns of adaptation or genetic
drift (Endler 1977).
<p>This increasing input of population biology into systematics and evolution
led to the proposal by Ehrlich &amp; Raven (1969), Levin (1979) and others
that species are not real biological units at all; instead, local populations
are the only real groupings united by gene flow within a common gene pool,
and which adapt to local conditions, compete, and so on. Any homogeneity
of ecological niche or genetics over the range of a species might be due
either to simple evolutionary inertia or to similar stabilizing selection
everywhere. To these authors species exist and are real in local communities;
but it is fallacious to treat distant populations in the same way (see
also VIII D below).
<p>This viewpoint is generally understood and respected by population biologists,
but curiously has not been incorporated explicitly into current thinking
on species in systematics and evolution. Perhaps there is a sneaking suspicion
that even very weak levels of gene flow may explain the species integrity
over wide areas.
<p>C. Phenetic species concept
<p>In the 1960s and 1970s, a major systematics movement proposed numerical
methods in taxonomy now usually referred to as phenetics. Pheneticists,
as they were called, argued that taxonomy and systematics should be based
on multivariate statistical analysis of characters rather than on underlying
evolutionary or biological process information. If taxa were defined by
non-evolutionary criteria, studies of evolution would be freed from the
tautology of testing hypotheses about processes, when those same processes
are used as assumptions in the definitions of taxa under study. Species,
like other taxa, would be defined in numerical taxonomy on the basis of
multivariate statistics, as clusters in phenotypic space (Sokal and Crovello
1970).
<p>Phenetics is reviled by those who believe that classifications should
be phylogenetic. However, the approach is closely similar to the intuitive
methods adopted by most actual taxonomists, who use multiple morphological
or genetic characteristics to sort individual specimens into discrete groups
between which there are few intermediates (see V A above). Some large areas
of practical taxonomy are based purely on this phenetic approach. Bacterial
systematists, for instance, use multiple biochemical tests to assign microbes
to species taxa. The usefulness of this taxonomic method is attested by
its success in hospitals for predicting pathogeneticity and antibiotic
sensitivity.
<p>Phenetic classifications based on morphology introduce the danger that,
if convergent characters are used as data, one may group unrelated forms
into paraphyletic or even polyphyletic taxa. In addition, single gene polymorphisms
and sexual dimorphism can affect multiple morphological characters. This
could lead to recognition of multiple species within polymorphic populations.
Sibling species, on the other hand, could be lumped into the same species
using a phenetic approach, unless a set of highly diagnostic characters
could be found.
<p>D. Genotypic cluster criterion
<p>For morphological or genetic gaps to exist between species, gene flow
between species (if any) must be balanced by an opposing force of disruptive
selection. In my own work, I had studied hybrid zones between geographic
forms of butterflies, and I attempted to show that a practical statistical
definition of species could be constructed using morphological and genetic
gaps alone, rather than using phylogetic or evolutionary processes that
caused the gaps to exist.
<p>However, to define species by means of the gaps between them requires
consideration of the nature of the gaps to avoid falling into the trap
of defining polymorphic forms as separate species, or of lumping sibling
species. Rather than merely using external morphology, in difficult cases
I proposed that we could consider the genetics as well. DNA has a digital,
rather than analogue code, so there is a genetic gap between virtually
any pair of individuals. Clearly, then, we cannot use just any discreteness
at the genetic level to define species. Separate sexes and polymorphic
female forms of mimetic <i>Papilio</i> butterflies also have gaps between
them in exactly this way. A genetic element, which may be a single base
pair, an allele at a gene, the entire mitochondrial genome, a chromosomal
rearrangement, or perhaps a sex chromosome, may determine the genetic or
morphological differences between such polymorphic forms.
<p>To be considered part of a single local population, and therefore part
of the same local species, we expect that polymorphic genetic elements
like mimicry genes and sex chromosomes will be mixed in with polymorphisms
at genetic elements found on other chromosomes or extrachromosomal DNA.
Each individual may be a distinct multilocus genotype, but we recognize
groupings of these genotypes because a polymorphism at one genetic element
is more or less independent of polymorphisms at another. Conversely, if
alleles at one locus are strongly associated with alleles at other, unlinked
elements, we have evidence for two separate populations or species.
<p>I therefore proposed a "genotypic cluster criterion" of species. Species
are recognized by morphological and genetic gaps between populations in
a local area rather than by means of the phylogeny, cohesion, or reproductive
isolation that are responsible for these gaps (Mallet 1995).
<i>In a local
area, a single species (the null hypothesis) is recognized if there is
but a single cluster in the frequency distribution of multilocus phenotypes
and genotypes. Separate species are recognized if there are several clusters
separated by multilocus phenotypic or genotypic gaps</i>. These gaps may
be entirely vacant, or they may contain low frequencies of intermediate
genotypes, or hybrids (Fig. 1). The definition is useful because one avoids
tautological thinking: hypotheses about speciation or phylogeny become
independent of assumptions about the nature of reproductive isolation or
phylogeny underlying the taxa studied.

<p><br>Genotypic clusters are neither profound nor original; I trace the
idea to Darwin (1859, see IIIA), although it undoubtedly goes further back
since its use does not require acceptance of evolution. Many similar proposals
have been made (Simpson 1937, Hutchinson 1968, Sokal &amp; Crovello 1970,
Avise &amp; Ball 1990, Cohan 1994, Smith 1994); in fact the approach is
similar to the practice used on morphology by most taxonomists (see VIIIA),
the phenetic concept (see VIIIC) and indeed by those who attempt a practical
application of the biological species concept (see below). This widespread
use of direct genotypic or morphological data, as opposed to reproductive
or phylogenetic inferences made from such data, has apparently lacked support
because its practitioners were loath to label it as a "concept". I intended
merely to justify the Darwinian and practical taxonomists' species definition
statistically and in terms of genetics, rather than to enforce the use
of genotypes instead of morphology to define species. Most genotypic cluster
species can be recognized morphologically; for example, minor pattern elements
in <i>Papilio</i> can be used to unite the various polymorphic forms; however,
with abundant molecular marker data we could easily use the criterion to
sort actual specimens.
<p>There is also nothing wrong with concluding after seeing a male butterfly
mating with an unlike female that they belong to the same species, but,
because hybridization does occur occasionally between forms normally thought
of as different species, one is not so much using the mating behaviour
itself to define species as inferring that the mating behaviour is a common
event.&nbsp; We believe that, if we were to analyse their genomes, the
two hybridizing forms would have similar genetic characteristics apart
from those determining sexual dimorphism, i.e. they would belong to the
same genotypic cluster. Instead of reproductive compatibility being the
primary criterion of species, we can turn the argument on its head: we
infer from limited data on reproductive compatibility that a single genotypic
cluster may result.
<p>Asexual forms, unclassifiable under the interbreeding concept, and arbitrarily
definable at any level under concepts depending on phylogeny, can be clustered
and classified as a genotypic clusters in exactly the same way as sexual
species. The precise taxonomic level of species clustering is potentially
somewhat arbitrary, as in the phylogenetic concepts, but at least the method
acknowledges this arbitrariness rather than pretending that some higher
evolutionary principle is being used. However, many asexual forms such
as bdelloid rotifers have easily distinguishable species taxa (Hutchinson
1968). In bacteria, competition is thought to structure promiscuous, but
largely asexual populations into recognizable genetic clusters (Cohan 1994,
see also V A above).
<p>Critics have argued that the genotypic cluster criterion in sexual species
is nothing other than a gene flow concept of species under a different
guise. This is true for one specialized interpretation of "gene flow".
If we define gene flow as the successful or effective as opposed to actual
input of genes, then it is easy to see a "gene flow criterion" becomes
similar to the "genotypic cluster" criterion: to find whether a hybridization
or gene flow event is successful, we must either follow every gene through
all possible descendants for all time, or we may examine the genotypic
state of a population and determine if genes from one form are mixed randomly
with genes from another form. It seems clear that looking for random association
of genes within genotypes in the genotypic cluster approach will be methodologically
the same as genotypic state analysis to determine whether a population
is interbreeding, but the latter requires additional assumptions. The genotypic
cluster criterion in sexual species could be looked upon simply as a practical
application of the biological species concept. However, I distinguish the
genotypic cluster criterion from the interbreeding concept, if only because
its name emphasizes that the definition is character-based, rather than
actually based on interbreeding, and is thus applicable to asexuals as
well as sexual species.
<p>If a single geographic race, which previously intergraded at all its
boundaries with other geographic races, were to split into two forms that
coexist as separate genotypic clusters, we could have a situation that
the original polytypic species became paraphyletic. The new species has
been derived from only one of the component subspecies. Thus paraphyly
of species must be recognized as a possibility under this definition, as
with both interbreeding and diagnostic concepts.
<p>E. The unreality of species in space and time
<p>Geographic races often form clusters differing at multiple loci from
other races in the same species. The interbreeding concept or genotypic
cluster criterion can be used to justify a classical polytypic species
if the various geographic races are separated by zones which contain abundant
intermediates (hybrids). We sample multilocus genotypes or phenotypes in
local areas of overlap and determine whether a single peak (one species,
i.e. abundant hybrids), or two peaks (two different species, i.e. rare
hybrids) are evident in the local genotypic distribution (Fig. 1). Hybridization
may occur, but if it is rare so that character and genotypic distributions
remain distinctly bimodal in zones of overlap, we usually classify them
as separate species, even under the interbreeding concept.
<p>Although this spatial extension of the local species is practical to
apply to any pair of forms in contact, it is unlikely to lead to general
agreement. The problem is that hybrid zones can be very narrow and may
separate forms that are highly distinct at multiple characters or loci,
in spite of complete unimodal blending in local areas of overlap. Even
adherents of the interbreeding concept are reluctant to lump such geographic
forms within the same species. Examples include North American swallowtail
butterflies (<i>Papilio glaucus</i>/<i>P. canadensis</i>, see Hagen et
al. 1991) and European toads (<i>Bombina bombina</i>/<i>B. variegata</i>,
see Szymura 1993).
<p>An even worse problem is found in "ring species", which form a continuous
band of intergrading subspecies, but whose terminal taxa may be incompatible,
and overlap without intergrading. A commonly cited example are the herring
gulls and lesser black-backed gulls (<i>Larus argentatus</i> complex, Mayr
1970). Similarly, while most hybrid zones between European <i>Bombina</i>
are unimodal, the same pair of taxa may have bimodal genotypic distributions
in other zones of overlap (Szymura 1993). Thus, geographic forms may be
apparently conspecific in some areas, but overlap as separate species in
other areas. Finally, if distinct populations are geographically isolated
and there is no area of overlap, one cannot disprove the null hypothesis
of "same species" under interbreeding or genotypic cluster criteria, but
biologists are reluctant to unite such populations if they are very divergent.
Laboratory hybridization could be tried, but many overlapping species are
known to hybridize freely in captivity, while remaining separate in nature.
There are good examples in the great apes, for instance the bonobo (<i>Pan
paniscus</i>) versus the chimpanzee (<i>P. troglodytes</i>), and the gorillas
(Uchida 1996), but similar decisions must be made in almost any animal
and plant group.
<p>The problem for spatial extensions of species criteria is in fact due
to the evolutionary divergence of spatially separated lineages: time and
space are correlated. Paleontologists face a similar temporal problem when
classifying fossils in different strata. Evolutionary rates may vary, but
all lineages must ultimately be continuous, so there is no very logical
place to put a species boundary in time any more than there is in space.
Paleontologists typically use operational species on the basis of morphological
gaps between taxa from the same and different time periods (Simpson 1937,
Smith 1994).
<p>These difficulties show that there is no easy way to tell whether related
geographic or temporal forms belong to the same or different species. Species
gaps can be verified only locally and at a single time. One is forced to
admit that Darwin's insight is correct: any local reality or integrity
of species is greatly reduced over large geographic ranges and time periods
(see also Mayr 1970, and IX D).
<p>IX. The importance of species concepts for biodiversity and conservation
<p>A. Traditional: species as real entities
<p>Different species concepts seek to define species in mutually incompatible
ways. Thus, a monophyletic species concept seems not very useful to evolutionary
biologists because of difficulties with multiple gene genealogies and paraphyletic
remnants. In contrast, the interbreeding concept and other combined concepts
incorporating biological processes of species maintenance suffer in the
eyes of phylogenetic systematists because they lack phylogenetic coherence
and produce paraphyletic taxa, or worse. If we were to allow the basal
unit of our taxonomy to incorporate paraphyly, it would be harder to justify
a strict adherence to monophyly at other taxonomic levels. It is beyond
the scope of this article to resolve these difficult issues, but these
conceptal conflicts fuel the continuation of the debate, and also highlight
the fact that if species are indeed real, objective biological units, their
unifying reality has been extremely difficult to verify.
<p>Many ecological and biodiversity studies of actual organisms ignore
these difficulties, and assume that species are objectively real basal
units. Thus in ecology, we have theories of global species diversity. In
conservation, we have the "Endangered Species Act" in the USA, which prescribes
the conservation of threatened taxa we call species. Populations not viewed
as species, particularly putative hybrid taxa (like the red wolf, <i>Canis
rufus</i>, of the SE USA), are seen as less valuable, even if rare. How
do we recognize that a taxon is hybridized? Obviously, to be a hybrid,
it must be a mere intergrade between two, real, objectively identifiable
entities. The Endangered Species Act views species as important real conservation
units and hybrids as unimportant. It did this because it incorporated the
species concept in vogue at the time of its enactment, i.e. the biological
species concept, in which hybridization is seen as a "breakdown in isolating
mechanisms" (Mayr 1970).
<p>B. Alternatives: genetic differences more valuable than species status
<p>If this Act were to be rewritten today, what would it say? There is
undoubtedly a greater realization today that other levels in the taxonomic
hierarchy are important elements of biodiversity. The diagnostic concept
of species, while claiming to support the basal, objective nature of species,
can at least have the beneficial effect of allowing its basal unit of biodiversity
to be recognized at a lower level, in this case as subspecies within polytypic
species. Some molecular geneticists have advocated conservation of "evolutionary
significant units", "management units", or "stocks" (a fisheries term)
defined on criteria of continuous genetic differentiation at molecular
markers (Moritz 1994) as being more important than worrying about the species
level at all. The true reality of spatiotemporally extended species eludes
us, if it exists. If this is so then it seems best to adopt some other
measure of conservation value that relies purely on the degree of genetic
differentiation, for instance at molecular genetic markers.
<p>C. Species differences as ecologically important markers.
<p>However, there are many who oppose this view. Species within a local
area such as a nature reserve are, for the most part, easily and objectively
identifiable using morphology, behaviour, genetics, or phylogeny. A pair
of similar species must usually be ecologically different to coexist. To
remain distinct, sexual species will need some prezygotic isolation, so
their mating behaviour must also be different. Thus, counting species in
a local area makes ecological sense, and conserving species diversity in
a local area would conserve actual ecological and behavioural diversity.
Behavioural and morphological differences that cause species-ness are evolutionarily
more valuable than potentially neutral genetic differences at molecular
markers.
<p>D. Biodiversity in space and time.
<p>As we have seen, this local view breaks down when we try to apply the
term "species" over large areas or geological time scales. In some cases,
there is excellent homogoneity over large areas; for example the painted
lady butterfly (<i>Vanessa cardui</i>) and the barn owl (<i>Tyto alba</i>)
have a virtually worldwide distribution and look nearly identical everywhere.
Other species are not so homogeneous: the familiar mallard group of ducks
(<i>Anas platyrhynchos</i>) has become highly differentiated into some
18 or so forms in far-flung outposts of the world, but exactly how many
are good species, and how many are races, or indeed, how many races there
are in total, is a matter of taste. Current authorities recognize about
10 species, but there might easily be five or 15 in alternative treatments.
One of the forms, the Mexican duck <i>A. platyrhynchos diazi </i>is threatened
with hybridization by its mallard relative <i>Anas platyrhynchos platyrhynchos</i>
which has been expanding from the north, and the American black duck (<i>Anas
rubripes</i>) also hybridizes with the mallard, but appears to resist hybridization
somewhat better than the Mexican form - hence its species status.
<p>Faced with these difficulties, should we worry about the species level
when conserving endangered taxa over large areas? Whatever the answer to
this question, it does not seem very sensible to rely too much on the spatiotemporal
reality of species for an answer. We might rename the Mexican Duck as a
separate species instead of a subspecies, but ideally this should not affect
its conservation value since there has been no actual change in the knowledge
of biological characteristics that affect conservation value. Most conservationists
now agree that the former fetish for species-level legislation was a mistake:
conservation and legislation should now recognize that living, evolving
populations form fractal continua over time and space, rather than attempting
a division into spurious "fundamental" units.
<p>Species are certainly fundamental units of <i>local</i> biodiversity,
but they have this clarity only in a small zone of time and space, and
so species counts become less and less meaningful as larger and larger
areas are covered. Taxonomists might come to nominalistic agreements on
a case-by-case basis, but even this shows little sign of happening yet.
Ecological theory, as well as conservation and biodiversity studies must
recognize that species counts over large expanses of space and time represent
only a sketchy measure of biodiversity, a measure which owes more to taxonomic
and metaphysical fashion than to science.
<p>GLOSSARY
<p>Cladistic a classification based entirely on monophyletic taxonomic
groupings within a phylogeny; taxonomic units that are paraphyletic or
polyphyletic are rejected. A cladist is one who practices cladistics, usually
in the sense of using parsimony to adjudicate between data from multiple
characters in the construction of a cladogram, which is an estimate of
the true phylogeny.
<br>Cohesion the sum total of forces or systems that hold a species together.
The term is used especially in the interbreeding and cohesion species concepts.
Cohesion mechanisms include isolating mechanisms in sexual species as well
as stabilizing ecological selection, which may cause cohesion even within
asexual lineages.
<br>Disruptive selection selection acting to preserve extreme phenotypes
in a population. Speciation usually involves disruptive selection, because
intermediates (hybrids between incipient species) are disfavoured (see
also stabilizing selection).
<br>Gene flow movement of genes between populations, usually via immigration
and mating of whole genotypes, but sometimes single genes may undergo horizontal
gene transfer via transfection by microorganisms.
<br>Gene pool the sum total of the genetic variation within a reproductively
isolated species population; this term is mostly used by supporters of
the interbreeding species concept.
<br>Isolating mechanisms the sum total of all types of factors that prevent
gene flow between species, including pre-mating mechanisms (mate choice),
and post-mating mechanisms (hybrid sterility and inviability). Modern authors
deny that these "mechanisms" have necessarily evolved to preserve the species'
integrity as originally assumed, though this may sometimes be the case
in reinforcement of pre-mating isolation. Isolating mechanisms are a subset
of the factors that cause cohesion of species under the interbreeding and
cohesion species concepts.
<br>Monophyletic a grouping that contains all of the descendants of a particular
node in a phylogeny. Monophyly is the state of such groupings. Compare
paraphyletic, polyphyletic. Butterflies (Rhopalocera) and birds (Aves)
are examples of two groups thought to be monophyletic.
<br>Paraphyletic a grouping that contains some, but not all of the descendants
of a particular node in a phylogeny. Paraphyly is the state of such groupings.
Compare monophyletic, polyphyletic. Moths (Lepidoptera, excluding butterflies)
and reptiles (amniotes, excluding birds and mammals) are examples of two
groups thought to be paraphyletic.
<br>Phenetic, a classification or grouping based purely on overall similarity.
Pheneticists use matrices of overall similarity rather than parsimony to
construct a phenogram as an estimate of the phylogeny. Examples of phenetic
methods of estimation include unweighted pair group analysis (UPGMA) and
neighbor joining. Cladists reject phenetic classifications on the grounds
that they may result in paraphyletic or polyphyletic groupings.
<br>Phylogenetic pertaining to the true (i.e. evolutionary) pattern of
relationship, usually expressed in the form of a binary branching tree,
or phylogeny. If hybridization produces new lineages, as is common in many
plants and some animals, the phylogeny is said to be "reticulate". Phylogenies
may be estimated using phenetics, parsimony (cladistics) or methods based
on statistical likelihood.
<br>Polyphyletic groupings contain taxa with more than one ancestor. Polyphyly
is the state of such groupings. Compare paraphyletic and monophyletic.
"Winged vertebrates" (including birds and bats) give an example of a polyphyletic
group.
<br>Real, reality two tricky words found frequently in the species concept
debate. "Reality" is typically used to support one's own species concept,
as in: "The conclusions set forth above ... lead to a belief in the reality
of species" (Poulton 1904); similar examples can by found in the writings
of Dobzhansky, Mayr, and especially phylogeneticists. The term reality
in this sense is similar to an Aristotelian "essence", a hypothetical pure,
albeit obscure truth that underlies the messy actuality; unfortunately,
in everyday language "real" also means "actual" (curiously, a "reality"
in the first sense may be "unreal" under the second!). By rejecting the
"reality" of species, one can therefore send very mixed messages: some
readers will understand the author to be a nominalist who merely believes
useful terms require little theoretical underpinning; others assume the
author is nonsensically using some definition that does not apply to actual
organisms. Here, when I discuss the reality underlying a species concept,
I mean it in the first sense, a hypothesis. Many authors of species concepts
and some philosophers of science argue that definitions must be underpinned
by a theoretical justification or reality. Other philosophers such as Wittgenstein
and Popper agree that terms need no such definition to be useful.
<br>Speciation the evolutionary process of the origin of a new species.
<br>Specific mate recognition systems (SMRS) fertilization and mate recognition
systems in the recognition concept of species, the factors leading to pre-mating
compatibility within a species. See also cohesion which is similar to SMRS,
but includes post-mating compatibility as well.
<br>Sibling species a pair of closely related, morphologically similar
species (usually sister species).
<br>Stabilizing selection selection which favours intermediate phenotypes.
