<b>species concepts</b> The concepts, or ideas, that underlie what biologists
mean by the term species. Evolution produces diversity at many levels,
from genes, races, species, to genera and higher taxa. There are many problems
in classifying this diversity, especially with regard to the level in the
evolutionary hierarchy in which to place a particular taxon. The species
has often been held in special regard as the only "real" taxon. However,
there are an extraordinary number of different concepts, ideas and definitions
of organic species; only a few can be summarized here.
<p>The ancient philosophical terms <i>genus </i>and <i>species </i>were
used in logic to classify objects and ideas as well as living organisms.
The species was a collection of objects that had a common underlying "<i>essence</i>";
in fact the Greek term for species and essence were the same (<img SRC="eidos.gif" height=23 width=47 align=TEXTTOP>).
The genus was a group of such species, with its own, broader essence. For
biological organisms, this <i>essentialism</i> fitted well with the biblical
story of creation, and Linnaeus adopted this essentialist view of classification
in his ambitious project to catalogue every organism known at the time
(18th Century). Linnaeus pioneered the use of <i>binomial nomenclature</i>,
Latin <i>scientific names</i> which serve as a shorthand for descriptions
of species. As an example, the scientific name of the yellow-shafted flicker
(a woodpecker) is <i>Colaptes auratus</i>, where <i>Colaptes</i> is the
generic and <i>auratus</i> the specific epithet.
<p>The rise of evolutionary ideas meant that the old creationist essentialism
was no longer tenable. Charles Darwin was interested in showing that species
evolved, but to do so he obviously had to develop a species concept which
depended neither on creation nor on evolution. If they evolved, varieties
and species could be continuous in space and time. Thus Darwin wrote: "hereafter,
we shall be compelled to acknowledge that the only distinction between
species and well-marked varieties is, that the latter are known, or believed,
to be connected at the present day by intermediate gradations, whereas
species were formerly thus connected." To Darwin, the origin of species
became the origin of the morphological gaps between populations. This species
concept has been called the <i>morphological species concept</i>, although
it emphasizes the clustering of members of the same species in morphological
space, rather than the fact that morphological characters were used in
its implementation.
<p>As the geographic representation of well-organized museum collections
increased, a major revolution in this Darwinian species concept began to
take place (1890-1920). It was shown that some apparently good species
of birds and butterflies blended together in areas of overlap or <i>hybrid
zones</i>. Related forms that hybridize and replace each other geographically
became downgraded to <i>subspecies</i> and were referred to by a novel
extension of the Linnaean system, which now could consist of a trinomial:
<i>genus-species-subspecies</i>.
For example, the red shafted flicker (formerly <i>Colaptes cafer</i>) is
now usually referred to as <i>Colaptes auratus cafer</i>, or the red-shafted
race of the common flicker. This species also includes the yellow-shafted
flicker, <i>C. auratus auratus</i>. Species with more than one <i>subspecies
</i>became
known as <i>polytypic species</i>. At the same time, other, more trivial
forms or varieties within local populations became excluded from the formal
Linnaean taxonomy.
<p>In the 1930s and 1940s, evolutionists became dissatisfied with the Linnaean/Darwinian
character-based definitions of species; they felt that species designations
could reflect a real underlying biological phenomenon rather than remaining
merely as categories for taxonomic convenience, and they wished to formalize
this reality by specifying their idea of the important biological process.
Drawing on ideas from Buffon and other early biologists, EB Poulton, T
Dobzhansky and E Mayr proposed what is now known as the <i>biological species
concept</i>, in which species are thought of as populations which do not
interbreed, and are therefore <i>reproductively isolated</i> from other
species. These ideas were developed along with (though do not necessarily
require) the idea that species were important units of evolution, and that
<b>isolating
mechanisms</b> were protective devices to maintain the genetic integrity
of the species.
<p>The <i>biological species concept</i> seems to have been largely accepted
by zoologists for about 30 years. On the other hand, botanists never fully
accepted the idea because plants often had high rates of hybridization,
local variability, and environmentally-induced plasticity. In recent years,
however, any semblance of agreement about species concepts, even among
zoologists, has been shattered. An explosion of new ideas has occurred.
One movement, spearheaded by PR Ehrlich and PH Raven has claimed that populations,
rather than species, are the important and real biological units of evolution.
Others claim that biological processes do underlie species, but each has
supported a different type of process as the important one. Examples include
L Van Valen's <i>ecological species concept</i>, in which species are defined
by their ecological niches, and HEH Paterson's <i>recognition concept of
species</i>, in which species are defined by sexual signalling or <i>specific
mate recognition systems</i> within species (see also <b>isolating mechanisms</b>).
The <i>cohesion concept of species</i> was proposed by A Templeton to combine
<i>reproductive
isolation</i>, ecological selection, and reproductive compatibility within
a single species concept. The major advantage of this idea was that both
hybridizing and asexual species which, which could not be classified under
the biological species concept, could be included.
<p>A completely different approach to species concepts has been to include
the idea of evolutionary history as opposed to merely the maintenance of
current species. The
<i>evolutionary species concept</i>, in which a species
is a lineage evolving separately from others, was proposed by GG Simpson
to allow fossils to be classified as species as well as living organisms.
This idea has been formalized recently in various types of
<i>phylogenetic
species concept</i>, in which the individuals that belong to a species
contain all the descendents of a single population of ancestors, that is
they are <i>monophyletic</i>. This group of ideas was developed by J Cracraft
and others specifically in response to an increase in the use of <i>cladistics</i>
in classification. In <i>cladistics</i>, only <i>apomorphies</i> (uniquely
derived traits) are used to unite groups; reproductive compatibility and
free hybridization supposedly cannot be used in species definitions because
they are primitive or <i>plesiomorphic </i>traits. Unfortunately, hybridization
may also allow genes to pass from one taxon to another, and so different
genes within groups of organisms may in fact have different phylogenies
(phylogenies of single genes are called <i>genealogies</i>). To get around
this problem of conflicting data, DL Baum and KL Shaw have suggested a
variant <i>phylogenetic species concept </i>based on the consensus of many
estimated genealogies of different genes; this is called the <i>genealogical
species concept</i>. Finally, A Templeton has recently added phylogenetic
and genealogical considerations, as well as ecology and reproductive isolation,
to his <i>cohesion concept of species</i>.

<p><br>Most recent species concepts (Ehrlich &amp; Raven's population concept
is an exception) attempt to identify the underlying biological "reality"
of species, and are therefore, to some extent, modern examples of essentialist
thought. From Mayr onwards, there has been a deliberate attempt to exclude
any consideration of usefulness of the term species from the discussions
about species concepts. This may be a mistake. The debate can be resolved
if we explicitly avoid using evolutionary history or the biological means
by which the integrity of a species is maintained, and instead strive for
a definition of species which is useful in taxonomy, evolutionary studies,
and conservation. Given that we now have abundant genetic data, we could
use a genetic version of Darwin's <i>morphological cluster</i> <i>concept</i>,
called by J Mallet the <i>genotypic cluster definition</i>. <i>Genotypic
clusters</i> can be identified by the presence of gaps between groups of
multilocus genotypes within a local area (Fig. 1), in the same way that
Darwin's <i>morphological cluster</i> <i>species</i> are identified by
morphological gaps; indeed morphology is often a good clue to genotype.
The <i>genotypic cluster definition</i> reverts back to the taxonomic practice
inherent in the <i>polytypic species</i> (in which races are judged conspecific
by means of abundant intermediates in hybrid zones). <i>Genotypic cluster
species</i> are indeed very similar to the practical taxonomic application
of the
<i>biological species concept</i>. It is of course likely that genotypic
cluster species will be maintained as distinct entities from one another
because of reproductive or ecological traits, and that they will achieve
evolutionary, phylogenetic, and genealogical separation through time. But
genotypic clusters may violate one or more of these biological or evolutionary
principles and yet remain distinct (Fig 1). The <i>genotypic cluster definition</i>
is therefore related to the <i>cohesion concept</i> in that it allows for
multiple means of cluster maintenance and evolution, but, instead of arbitrating
between every possible process of cohesion, it merely examines the genetic
results of the combination of processes. Species as genotypic clusters
are easier to use in taxonomy, and in conservation, and in the investigation
of speciation (the evolution of genotypic gaps that do not dissolve in
sympatry) than species based on idealized evolutionary or biological concepts,
because studies of biological and evolutionary processes are not required
before the work starts.&nbsp; See the example in Fig. 2.

<p><br>The profusion of species concepts in the biological literature is
currently a major hindrance to the study of biological diversity, and its
use in conservation and evolutionary investigations. And yet, biologists
no longer argue about "cell concepts", or "gene concepts", presumably because
the concepts of cells as units of tissue, and DNA as the genetic material,
are now broadly understood. We continue to disagree about species concepts
because we do not yet understand species very well; at the same time, we
need to make decisions because species themselves are going extinct at
an accelerating rate. These arguments may exist because we are asking the
wrong questions (perhaps species do not really exist?), but more probably
because we still have much to learn about species. In any case, it is to
be hoped that a generally applicable and useful idea of species will soon
put an end to the current chaos. Darwin's concept may still be the that
best and most useful solution.
