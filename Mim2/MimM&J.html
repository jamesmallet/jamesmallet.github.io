<br>ABSTRACT</center>

<p>Mimicry and warning color are highly paradoxical adaptations. Color
patterns in both M&uuml;llerian and Batesian mimicry are often determined
by relatively few pattern-regulating loci with major effects. Many of these
loci are "supergenes", consisting of multiple tightly-linked epistatic
elements. On the one hand, strong purifying selection on these genes must
explain accurate resemblance (a reduction of morphological diversity between
species), as well as monomorphic color patterns within species. On the
other hand, mimicry has diversified at every taxonomic level: warning color
has evolved from cryptic patterns, and there are mimetic polymorphisms
within species, multiple color patterns in different geographic races of
the same species, mimetic differences between sister species, and multiple
mimicry rings within local communities. These contrasting patterns can
be explained, in part, by the shape of a "number-dependent" selection function
first modeled by Fritz M&uuml;ller in 1879: purifying selection against
any warningly-colored morph is very strong when that morph is rare, but
becomes weak in a broad basin of intermediate frequencies, allowing opportunities
for polymorphisms and genetic drift. This M&uuml;llerian explanation, however,
makes unstated assumptions about predator learning and forgetting which
have recently been challenged. Today's "receiver psychology" models predict
that classical M&uuml;llerian mimicry could be much rarer than believed
previously, and that, "quasi-Batesian mimicry", a new type of mimicry intermediate
between M&uuml;llerian and Batesian, could be common. However, this receiver
psychology theory is untested, and indeed seems unlikely; alternative assumptions
could easily lead to a more traditional M&uuml;llerian/Batesian mimicry
divide.

<br>INTRODUCTION
<p>Since their discovery, anti-predator mimicry and warning colors have
been used as simple and visually appealing examples of natural selection
in action. This simplicity is beguiling, and controversy has often raged
behind the textbook examples. Warning color and mimicry have been discussed
from three different points of view: a traditional insect <i>natural history</i>
angle, which makes simplistic assumptions about both predator behavior
and prey evolution (6, 103, 122, 175); an <i>evolutionary dynamics</i>
angle, which virtually ignores predator behavior and individual prey/predator
interactions (37, 47, 54, 91, 162); and a predator <i>behavior</i> (or
"receiver psychology") angle (59-61, 71-72, 115, 148-150), which tends
to be simplistic about evolutionary dynamics. Assumptions are necessary
to analyse any mathematical problem, but the sensitivity of mimicry to
these different simplifications remains untested.
</p><p>We believe it will be necessary to combine these disparate views (for
example, 111, 133, 181) in order to resolve controversy and explain paradoxical
empirical observations about the evolution of mimicry. Mimicry should progressively
reduce numbers of color patterns, but the actual situation is in stark
contrast: there is a diversity of "mimicry rings" (a mimicry ring is a
group of species with a common mimetic pattern) within any single region;
closely related species and even adjacent geographic races often differ
in mimetic or warning color pattern; and there are locally stable polymorphisms.
The current controversies and problems are not simply niggles with the
theory of mimicry, designed to renew flagging interest in a largely solved
area of evolutionary enquiry. Instead, they probe the heart of the textbook
explanations we have all learnt. In our review, we will often conclude
that traditional interpretations are correct. However, recent challenges
and critiques are worth examining carefully because they cast justifiable
doubt about previously unstated assumptions. A further reason for re-examining
the evolution of mimicry is that its frequency-dependent selective landscapes
are rugged, as in mate choice and hybrid inviability (55), so that mimicry
provides a model system for the shifting balance theory (41, 178-180);
mimicry may also act as a barrier to isolate species (96). While a number
of interesting peculiarities of mimicry arguably have little general importance
(57), mimicry excels in providing an intuitively understandable example
of multiple stable equilibria and transitions between them (41, 87, 97-98,
161, 167). Mimicry and warning color are highly variable both geographically
within species, and also between sister species. In this, they are similar
to other visual traits involved in signalling and speciation, such as sexually
selected plumage morphology and color in birds (2). Sexual and mimetic
coloration may therefore share some explanations in common.
</p><p>This article aims to cover only the evolution of diversity in mimicry
systems, and we will skate quickly over many issues reviewed elsewhere
(19, 20, 32, 40, 45, 49, 123, 125, 129, 134, 170, 176; see also a list
of over 600 references in ref. 90). Our discussion mainly concerns anti-predator
visual mimicry, though it may apply to other kinds of mimicry and aposematism,
for example warning smells (62, 130), and mimicry of behavioral pattern
(18, 152-154). In addition, most of our examples are shamelessly taken
from among the insect mimics and their models, usually butterflies, that
we know best; careful studies on the genetics or ecology of other systems
have rarely been done.
<br>&nbsp;
</p><p>MIMICRY AND WARNING COLOR: THE BASICS
</p><p>Bates (6) noticed two curious features among a large complex of butterflies
of the Amazons. First, color patterns of unrelated species were often closely
similar locally; second, these "mimetic" patterns changed radically every
few hundred miles, "as if by the touch of an enchanter's wand" (8). Bates
argued that very abundant slow-flying Ithomiinae (related to monarch butterflies)
were distasteful to predators, and that palatable species, particularly
dismorphiine pierids (related to cabbage whites) "mimicked" them; that
is, natural selection had caused the pattern of the "mimic" to converge
on that of the "model" species. This form of mimicry became known as Batesian
(122). The term "mimicry" had already been used somewhat vaguely by pre-Darwinian
natural philosophers for a variety of analogical resemblances (13), but
Bates's discovery was undoubtedly a triumph of evolutionary thinking.
</p><p>Bates also noticed that rare unpalatable species such as <i>Heliconius</i>
(Heliconiinae) and <i>Napeogenes</i> (Ithomiinae) often mimicked the same
common ithomiine models (such as <i>Melinaea</i>, <i>Oleria</i> and <i>Ithomia</i>)
copied by dismorphiines. He assumed that this "mimetic resemblance was
intended" (6: p. 554) because, regardless of palatability, a rare species
should benefit from similarity to a model. However, where the apparently
mimetic species was common, as in the similarity of unpalatable
<i>Lycorea</i>
(Danainae) to ithomiine models, he felt this was "a curious result of [adaptation
to] local [environmental] conditions" (6: p. 517); in other words convergent
evolution unrelated to predation. It was left to Fritz M&uuml;ller (103)
to explain clearly the benefits of mimicry in pairs of unpalatable species.
If a constant number of unpalatable individuals per unit time must be sacrificed
to teach local predators a given color pattern, the fraction dying in each
species will be reduced if they share a color pattern, leading to an advantage
to mimicry. Thus, mimicry between unpalatable species became known as M&uuml;llerian
mimicry.
</p><p>Many mimetic species are also warningly colored, but some are not: for
example the larvae of a notodontid moth (6) and of <i>Dynastor darius</i>
(Brassolidae) (1), which both mimic highly poisonous but cryptic pit vipers
(Viperidae). The former mimics even the keeled scales of its model; the
latter has eyes which mimic the snake's own eyes, even down to the slit-shaped
pupils. Many small clearwing ithomiines Bates studied in the tropical rainforest
understory are also very inconspicuous, but are clearly mimetic. Mimicry
doesn't require a warningly colored model, only that potential predators
develop aversions to the model's appearance. Warning color, or "aposematism"
(122) was first developed as an evolutionary hypothesis by Wallace in response
to a query from Darwin, four years after Bates' publication on mimicry.
Darwin's sexual selection theory (42) explained much bright coloration
in animals, but could not explain conspicuous black, yellow, and red sphingid
caterpillars found by Bates in Brazil, because the adult sexual stage does
not choose mates on the basis of larval colors. Wallace in 1866 (see 42,
175) suggested that bright colors advertised the unpalatability of the
larvae, in the same way that yellow and black banding advertised defensive
sting of a hornet (Vespidae). Warning color in effect must increase the
efficiency with which predators learn to avoid unpalatable prey (see also
refs. 59, 61 for excellent discussion of possible advantages of warning
color).
<br>&nbsp;
</p><p>NUMBER DEPENDENT SELECTION ON MIMICRY AND WARNING COLOR
</p><p>It was apparently not clear to the natural history viewpoint of early
Darwinians (6, 8, 42, 103, 122, 175) that explaining aposematism and mimicry
as adaptations often requires an additional assumption: that long-term
group fitness will always be maximized. In fact, there are multiple stability
peaks in the selective "landscape" of mimetic evolution, and there should
often be initial barriers to the spread of ultimately beneficial unpalatability,
warning color, and some mimicry. To understand why this is so, we must
examine the evolutionary dynamics of mimicry.
</p><p>M&uuml;ller (103) was the first to formulate the benefits of mimicry
explicitly, using mathematical intuition from a natural history perspective
(reprinted in 78). He assumed that, while learning to avoid the color pattern
of unpalatable species, a predator complex killed a fixed number of individuals
per unit time. M&uuml;llerian mimicry is favored, therefore, because the
<i>per
capita</i> mortality rate decreases when another unpalatable species shares
the same pattern. If this traditional naturalist's "number-dependent" (162)
view of mimicry is correct, it leads to two interesting predictions, only
one of which M&uuml;ller himself apparently appreciated. The first is that,
although M&uuml;llerian mimicry of this kind should always be mutualistic,
a rare species ultimately gains far more from mimicry than a common one,
in proportion to the square of the ratio of abundances (103). The second
prediction is that a novel mimetic variant in the rarer species resembling
the commoner is always disfavored because the common species generates
greater numerical protection, while a mimetic variant of the commoner species
is always disfavored because it loses the strong protection of its own
kind and gains only weak protection from the rarer pattern (161). Both
these effects will tend to cause rarer unpalatable species to mimic commoner
models, rather than the other way around, in spite of the fact that the
mimetic state is mutualistic once reached.
</p><p>M&uuml;ller's number-dependent selection applies similarly to morphs
within a single species (<a href="MimM&amp;JFig1.html">Fig. 1</a>). A warningly
colored variant within a cryptic but unpalatable prey will suffer a two-fold
disadvantage: first, it is more conspicuous to predators; second, it does
not gain from warning color because predators, not having learnt to avoid
the pattern, may attack it. This creates a barrier to initial spread, even
though, once evolved, warning color is beneficial because by definition
it reduces the number of prey eaten during predator learning (67). In exactly
the same way, a novel warning pattern is disfavored within an already warningly
colored species, essentially because of intraspecific mimicry (97, 89;
also Fig. 1). This selection against rarity makes it easy to understand
why warningly colored races are normally fixed, and sharply separated by
narrow overlap zones from other races (27, 87, 93), but in turn makes it
hard to understand how geographic races diversified in the first place
(6, 8, 87, 89, 98, 137, 167). Similarly, if energy is required to synthesize
or sequester distasteful compounds, unpalatability itself may be disfavored
(49, 63, 67, 160) because unpalatable individuals may sacrifice their lives
in teaching predators to avoid other members of their species. The tussle
to explain the difficulties with this new, more sophisticated
<i>evolutionary
dynamic</i> view of aposematism are detailed in the following section.
<br>&nbsp;
</p><p>POPULATION STRUCTURE AND THE EVOLUTION OF WARNING COLOR AND UNPALATABILITY
</p><p><i>The Evolution of Unpalatability</i>
</p><p>Unpalatability itself is hard to define (20, 151; see also below under
<i>M&uuml;llerian
Mimicry</i>), but here we mean the term loosely to mean any trait which
acts on predators as a punishment, and which causes learning leading to
reduced attack rate. Unpalatability has long been recognized as a potentially
altruistic trait which may require kin selection for its evolution. The
unpalatable individual may incur costs in synthesis or processing of distasteful
chemistry and is often likely to suffer damage during predator sampling,
while only other members of the population benefit from predator learning.
The frequent aposematism of gregarious larvae, often siblings from the
same brood, suggests that benefits are shared among kin, and that kin selection
could have been responsible for the evolution of unpalatability (49, 63,
67, 160). These authors assumed that altruistic unpalatability was unlikely
to evolve unless kin-groups already existed, so explaining the association
between gregarious larvae and unpalatability.
</p><p>However, unpalatability may not be very costly. Firstly, although it
may be expensive to process distasteful secondary compounds, in some cases
the same biochemical machinery is required to exploit available food; for
instance, <i>Zygaena</i> and
<i>Heliconius</i>, which feed on cyanogenic
host plants, can also synthesize their own cyanogens (70, 76, 104). Secondly,
because most toxic compounds also taste nasty (arguably the sense of taste
has evolved to protect eaters from toxic chemistry), and because predators
often taste-test their prey before devouring them, and, finally, because
unpalatable insects are often tough and resilient, an unpalatable insect
should often gain an individual advantage by sequestering distasteful chemicals.
A good example of predator behavior showing this is possible is seen in
birds feeding on monarch (<i>Danaus plexippus</i>) aggregations at their
overwintering sites in Mexico: birds taste-reject some butterflies more
or less unharmed, until they find a palatable individual which is then
killed and eaten (29).
</p><p>Another problem with empirical evidence for kin selection is that gregariousness,
which reduces per capita detectability of the prey, is expected to evolve
when there is any tendency towards predator satiation (14, 64, 157, 160);
and one of the best ways of satiating predators is to be distasteful. Thus
the association between gregarious larvae and unpalatability can easily
be explained because gregariousness will evolve much more readily after
unpalatability, rather than previously as in the kin selection hypothesis.
This expected pattern of unpalatability first, gregariousness thereafter
is now well supported in Lepidoptera by phylogenetic analysis (139, 141).
In conclusion, the supposed necessity for kin selection in the evolution
of unpalatability is now generally disbelieved (59, 97, 139), although
kin selection could, of course, help.
<br>&nbsp;
</p><p><i>Evolution of Novel Warning Colors in Cryptic and Aposematic Defended
Prey</i>
</p><p>Although the realization that aposematic insects may be altruistic came
70 years ago (49), it was finally some 50 years later that the evolution
of warning color was explicitly disentangled from the evolution of unpalatability
(66-67). Under M&uuml;ller's number-dependent theory, intraspecific M&uuml;llerian
mimicry acting on a novel warningly colored variant <i>A</i> within a population
would strongly favor the commonest, wild-type morph <i>a</i>; the frequency-dependent
selection is thus purifying, tending to prevent polymorphism (A). If unpalatable
prey often survive attacks, it might be argued that the problem will be
surmounted (47, 73-74, 177). However, this is not true provided that attacks
are even potentially damaging; <i>n<sub>k</sub></i> the "effective number
killed" may take fractional or probabilistic values, but the frequency-dependent
logic applies in exactly the same way (68, 97).
</p><p>An interesting feature of number-dependence is the great non-linearity
of frequency-dependent selection. Many authors from the evolutionary dynamics
tradition have assumed a simpler linear frequency-dependence (dotted line
in <a href="MimM&amp;JFig1.html">Fig. 1</a>) (47, 54, 87, 91, 121). In fact
the relationship between selection and frequency becomes more sigmoidal
as <i>n<sub>k</sub></i>/<i>N</i> decreases. When <i>n<sub>k</sub></i> &lt;&lt;
<i>N</i>,
there are strong spikes of selection against
<i>A</i> and <i>a</i> when
each is rare, but much of the frequency range forms a nearly neutral polymorphic
basin (<i>N</i>=100,
<a href="MimM&amp;JFig1.html">Fig. 1</a>). Another interesting
feature of this model is that the mean fitness surface is flat: assuming
most predators learn the pattern and then avoid it, the mean fitness throughout
the frequency spectrum becomes approximately constant at 1 - [<i>n<sub>k</sub></i>(<i>A</i>)+<i>n<sub>k</sub></i>(<i>a</i>)]/<i>N
</i>(<a href="MimM&amp;JFig1.html">Fig.
1</a>B). This is an extreme example of how mean fitness cannot be guaranteed
to improve when the fitness function is frequency-dependent (65). (Mimetic
and warning color patterns may, of course, vary continuously, and not as
discrete patterns (82); this may also contribute to evolution of warning
color and mimicry - see under <i>Pattern Enhancement and Peak-shift</i>
and <i>Mimetic Polymorphism and Genetic Architecture</i>, below.)
</p><p>In the real world, not only do warning colors exist, but also novel
warning patterns are forever being multiplied in already warningly colored
species (see under <i>Genetic drift and the shifting balance</i>) in spite
of the difficulties biologists foresee in initial evolution. Various ideas
have been proposed:
</p><p>1) <i>Novelty, Recognizability and "Green-beard" Selection.</i> It has
been suggested that warning colors can evolve because they induce predator
neophobia and because they are easier to learn (140, 177). Neophobia has
some experimental evidence (45, 140), while increased memorability is part
of the definition of warning color (see above). These factors, coupled
with a high survival rate of attacked prey might seem to allow warning
color to increase from low frequency in spite of increased conspicuousness
(140, 177). Unfortunately, the problem with fear of novelty is that this
survival advantage evaporates after a time, and enhanced learning is useful
only if there are enough individuals available to do the teaching. This
behavior viewpoint is rarely coupled with much thought about evolutionary
dynamics. Thus, even the existence of an unpalatable sea slug that survives
100% of attacks by fish (158) seems likely to have some risk, or loss of
fitness due to fish biting; any slight loss of fitness will be progressively
diluted as the numbers increase, leading, again, to frequency-dependent
selection against the rare form. In fact, M&uuml;llerian mimicry or warning
color would be unnecessary if this selection against rarity were not present.
An increase of conspicuousness will almost always lead to an initially
greater level of attack on the first few individuals with the new pattern,
even if the pattern is ultimately advantageous once fixed within the population
(59, 81, 97). Essentially, <i>Nn<sub>k</sub></i>(A)&lt;=<i>n<sub>k</sub></i>(a)
for warning color <i>A</i> to spread - the learning advantage must outweigh
the population size disadvantage for the first <i>A</i> mutant. With reasonably
large prey population sizes, say
<i>N</i>&gt;10, for a reasonably unpalatable
species, this seems almost impossible; given that <i>A</i> is more conspicuous,
the possibility seems even more remote (89, 97). In any case, high rates
of beak-marks on the wings of brightly colored unpalatable butterflies
attest to a high frequency of potentially lethal attacks (11, 30-31, 91,
111). Nonetheless, there are various possibilities that allow warning colors
to cheat against this apparent selective disadvantage. These are reviewed
below.
</p><p>2) <i>Preadaptation</i>. This idea is motivated by the fact that many
palatable insects, particularly butterflies, are already brightly colored.
Cryptic resting postures, and rapid, jinking flight allow these insects
to expose conspicuous patterns in flight which may be important for intraspecific
signalling in mate choice and sexual selection (42) or in territoriality
and male-male interactions (138, 169), as deflection markings (45, 128,
176), or in Batesian mimicry. If these species become unpalatable, perhaps
as a result of a need to process toxic secondary compounds in food, their
conspicuous patterns, already adapted for signalling, could simply be re-used
in predator education.
</p><p>3) <i>Pattern Enhancement and Peak-shift</i>. The representation of
a pattern in a predator's memory is likely to be a caricature of the actual
pattern. Thus an exaggerated pattern may be avoided by a predator more
strongly than the normal pattern on which the predator originally trained,
and exaggerated warning patterns will evolve to exploit this predator bias.
Training an artificial neural network model can also recreate this kind
of perceptual bias for supernormal stimuli (3, 48). Whether perceptual
bias is produced in computer models is strongly assumption-dependent (79),
but there is good evidence for exaggerated responses to supernormal stimuli
in vertebrate perception (156), which seem likely to have been a cause
of exaggerated male traits in sexual selection (110, 131). These perceptual
biases in vertebrates may contribute to the evolution of warning colors.
</p><p>A related idea is "peak-shift" whereby, if zones of negative and positive
reinforcement are located close together along a perceptual dimension,
they may each cause the perceiver to bias their responses further apart
(<a href="MimM&amp;JFig2.html">Fig. 2</a>). Peak shift is not dissimilar from
the old idea that warning colors function by appearing as different as
possible from the color patterns of edible prey (49, 59-61,164). Theory
shows that peak-shift can produce gradual evolution of warning colors (133,
181), and recent experiments with birds have demonstrated relevant perceptual
bias (52, 84).
</p><p>It seems likely that at least some warning colors evolved by this route.
For example, the patterns of conspicuous morphine butterflies <i>Taenaris</i>
and <i>Hyantis</i> are clearly related to those of cryptic morphines and
satyrines, such as <i>Morphopsis</i> with deflective eyespot patterns similar
to many other edible members of the satyrid lineages to which they belong.
<i>Taenaris</i>
and <i>Hyantis</i> have apparently evolved unpalatability, perhaps as a
result of feeding on toxic Cycadaceae, both as larvae on leaves, and as
adults on sap and fruits. Compared with the drab <i>Morphopsis</i>, color
and brightness have been enhanced, eyespot size has been increased, and
eyespot number has been reduced. A variety of Batesian mimics from palatable
genera such as <i>Elymnias agondas</i> (Satyrinae), and females of <i>Papilio
aegeus</i> (Papilioninae), apparently mimic these <i>Taenaris</i>/<i>Hyantis</i>
patterns (116-117), which attest to the unpalatability of the latter.
</p><p>Although likely to explain some warning color evolution, it is hard
to imagine that all novel warning patterns evolved by enhancement. The
color patterns of related species, or even races of <i>Heliconius</i>,
for example, seem so radically divergent as to preclude one being an enhancement
of the other. Of course, this is a dubious anthropocentric argument, but
the major gene switches in <i>Heliconius</i> suggest that radical shifts,
rather than gradual enhancement of existing patterns are responsible for
much of the pattern diversity within already warningly colored lineages.
If this is the case for switches between warning patterns, then the need
for enhancement and predator bias, even for the initial switch, seems less
pressing.
</p><p>4) <i>M&uuml;llerian Mimicry</i> is another way that a newly unpalatable
species might become warningly colored. While the constraints to the evolution
of M&uuml;llerian mimicry discussed above apply, the widespread existence
of M&uuml;llerian mimicry suggests that the idea should work both in the
initial evolution of warning color and in its diversification within already
unpalatable lineages. Because many species typically join in M&uuml;llerian
mimicry rings (9-10, 22-25, 116), it seems likely that, in butterflies,
<i>most</i>
warning color switches are due to M&uuml;llerian mimicry. Only the initial
divergence of mimicry rings needs to be explained in some other way (24,
89, 98, 167).
</p><p>5) <i>Density-dependent Warning Color</i>. Our formulation so far of
number-dependent warning color and M&uuml;llerian mimicry (see <a href="MimM&amp;JFig1.html">Fig.
1</a>) assumes all individuals are seen by predators, but in fact apparency,
as well as density <i>per se</i> is important for the ultimate benefits
of warning colors. If more prey are killed during predator learning of
a warning pattern than would be detected and killed for a cryptic population
of the same size, it may pay the prey to remain cryptic. This may explain
why many stationary pupae of unpalatable insects, such as <i>Heliconius</i>,
are brown and resemble dead leaves, while their more apparent and mobile
larvae and adults are brightly colored and classically aposematic. Density-dependent
color pattern development in <i>Schistocerca</i> (desert locusts and their
relatives) shows a switch from crypsis at low density to advertisement
of food-induced unpalatability at high density (155), and predation experiments
with <i>Anolis</i> lizards support the idea (155). If so, enhancement of
characteristics used by predators for recognition may provide a way in
which this kind of warning color evolves (133, 155, 181); this could represent
an easy route to warning color in some organisms. Nonetheless, density-dependent
facultative warning colors are unlikely in most animals, such as adult
butterflies, in which color patterns are fixed.
<br>&nbsp;
</p><p>6) <i>Kin Selection, Kin-founding</i>, <i>and "Green-beard" Selection</i>.
Predators attacking kin groups can kill or damage some individuals, but,
after doing so, avoid others who are relatives carrying the same pattern.
A superior warning pattern may therefore increase locally under a kind
of kin group selection (67). This is somewhat different to classical kin
selection, because benefits are transferred between individuals of like
phenotype, rather than according to degree of relationship (58): the effect
has therefore been called "family selection" (66), or "kin-founding" (97).
Guilford (58, 59) pointed out that warning color is a concrete and uncheatable
"green-beard" trait, a hypothetical type of altruism invented by Dawkins
(43) whereby altruists carrying a badge (such as a green beard) recognize
other altruists because they also carry the badge. More recently, the general
term "synergistic selection" (61, 81-82, 99, 139) has been applied to such
traits. The synergism can be viewed as a behavioral explanation of the
warning color trait, once evolved, but the knowledge of the nature of the
synergism does not explain its initial evolution because both a fixed absence
of the trait and the fixed presence of the trait are evolutionary stable
strategies (99). The population genetic problem of frequency-dependence
shown in <a href="MimM&amp;JFig1.html">Fig. 1</a> still arises, and it seems
clear that kin founding could aid the initial increase of novel warning
colors (59, 97).
</p><p>Whether kin founding is important for the initial or subsequent evolution
of novel warning colors seems hard to decide (see also under <i>Genetic
Drift and the Shifting Balance</i>). However, the evidence for kin-grouping
and larval gregariousness in many unpalatable insects does not seem such
good evidence now as formerly for kin-founding, for reasons already discussed
above under the evolution of unpalatablity by kin selection: in most cases,
gregariousness seems to have evolved after the evolution of unpalatability
and aposematism (139, 141).
<br>&nbsp;
</p><p>7) <i>Genetic Drift and the Shifting Balance</i>. Although kin-founding
can be looked upon as a purely deterministic model similar to kin selection
(66), it is clear that, like Sewall Wright's "shifting balance" model of
evolution (178-180) it requires a small local population size: the phenotypes
of a small group of related individuals must dominate the learning and
recognition systems of local predators, which is only possible if the total
local population is low. The evolution of warning color <i>via</i> kin-founding
is in fact a special case of phases I &amp; II of the shifting balance
(89, 97-98, 167). In phase I, genetic drift allows a local population to
explore a new adaptive peak; in phase II, local selection causes the population
to adapt fully to the new adaptive peak. Although not usually treated in
kin-founding models (but see 66), phase III of the shifting balance, i.e.
spread of the new adaptive peak to other populations, would clearly be
an important final phase in the kin-founding process. This would be equivalent
to having local populations with different warning colors competing across
narrow bands of polymorphism, as is actually the case in many hybrid zones
between geographic races of warningly colored species today; movement of
these clines for warning color would be the equivalent of Phase III (87,
98). In warning color, stable and unstable equilibria are peaks and troughs
of relative fitness, but not necessarily of mean fitness: under purely
number-dependent selection (<a href="MimM&amp;JFig1.html">Fig. 1</a>), mean
fitness is a constant independent of frequency, 1 - [<i>n<sub>k</sub></i>(<i>A</i>)+<i>n<sub>k</sub></i>(<i>a</i>)]/<i>N</i>,
and under the linear frequency-dependent selection model, the minimum of
mean fitness is not at the unstable equilibrium (0.4 in <a href="MimM&amp;JFig1.html">Fig.
1</a>). If <i>A</i> is more memorable than <i>a</i>, then <i>n<sub>k</sub></i>(<i>A</i>)
&lt;
<i>n<sub>k</sub></i>(<i>a</i>), but this does not increase the mean
fitness when <i>q<sub>A</sub></i> is high, except very close to fixation
of <i>A</i> when hardly any <i>a</i> are available to be tasted by predators.
</p><p>A recent critique of the shifting balance model concluded that chromosomal
evolution, warning color evolution, and more general patterns of phenotypic
adaptation were almost always better explained by ordinary individual selection
(41). For warning color and mimicry, the key problems are that natural
selection seems too intense so that drift is unlikely, and, in common with
other examples of rugged adaptive surfaces, phase III of the shifting balance
seems an inefficient means of spreading better warning patterns. While
these problems seem serious, key features of warning color considerably
increase the chances of shifting balance occurring. Firstly, although selection
for warning color can often be extremely strong, it would be surprising
if predator attacks were not sometimes reduced or suspended locally, due
to temporary absence of key predators such as flycatchers or jacamars (34-35,
119-120). If so, populations can occasionally drift to become polymorphic
because of a relaxation of selection. Provided that the prey are abundant
compared with their predators, <i>n<sub>k</sub> &lt;&lt; N</i>, and the
populations will quickly enter the central basin where selection is weak
(e.g. for
<i>N</i> = 100 in <a href="MimM&amp;JFig1.html">Fig. 1</a>). Here
drift, or mild forms of selection other than that due to warning function
may cause a new pattern to rise in frequency above the unstable equilibrium
(phase I), whereupon selection can fix and refine the new pattern (phase
II). An interface between new and old patterns will form, resulting in
a cline similar to hybrid zones between races observed today. If one pattern
is superior at warning away predators, asymmetries of selection will drive
it into the range of the other behind a narrow moving cline (phase III).
Cline movement seems likely; with strong selection in the clines observed
in nature (93), fairly rapid movement is predicted (91). The shifting balance
proposal is speculative because we know little about the frequency, timing
and depth of episodes of selection relaxation required for phase I, the
relative advantages of different warning colors across clinal boundaries
required for phase III, and whether population structural constraints will
prevent cline movement (4, 69, 89, 98).
</p><p>However, empirical evidence for all phases suggest the shifting balance
is likely:
<br>(a) polymorphism seems to exist regularly among M&uuml;llerian mimics
(see below under
<i>M&uuml;llerian Mimicry, Polymorphism and the Palatability
Spectrum</i>), showing that, in spite of strong selection acting sometimes
on mimicry (11, 75, 80, 92), at other times, reduced selection, genetic
drift, and non-mimetic selection allowing polymorphism in the central basin
seem actually to occur; (b) the strong purifying selection that is the
problem for phase I promotes phase II; and (c) the existence of today's
narrow clines, and biogeographic evidence for past cline movement and movement
in historical times suggests that phase III is also likely. The current
disjunct distribution of genetically homologous "postman" patterns of <i>Heliconius
erato</i> and its M&uuml;llerian co-mimic
<i>Heliconius melpomene</i> in
peripheral populations strongly suggests that some such competitive cline
movement in favor of central Amazonian "dennis-ray" patterns of this nature
has occurred, even if the color patterns have been sometimes restricted
to Pleistocene refuges in the past (24, 27, 89, 98, 137, 164). There is
some empirical evidence for movement of <i>Heliconius</i> clines this century
- although slow on a historical scale, the movement of warning color clines
could be very fast relative to an evolutionary time scale. (d) The shifting
balance does seem to have a strong potential in explaining geographic diverence
within species, the strong differences in warning color and mimicry between
sister species, and also the extraordinary diversity and novelty of these
patterns (98). If the shifting balance is important for current diversification,
there is little reason to doubt that it could also have been important
in the murky initial stages of the origins of warning color, though evidence
has long since been erased by more recent evolution within already aposematic
lineages.

</p><p>DIMORPHISM AND POLYMORPHISM IN MIMICRY
</p><p><i>Sex-limited Mimicry</i>
</p><p>In a minority of Batesian mimetic butterflies, females are mimetic,
while males, although brightly colored, are not. Such cases can be explained
if males are constrained to be non-mimetic by sexual selection, either
via female choice (162-163), or by the requirements of combat or other
male-male signalling (138, 169). This topic has been reviewed excellently
elsewhere (164; see also 78), so we do not treat it in detail here.
</p><p>Sexual selection may explain sexually dimorphic mimicry, but there are
some peculiarities of female-limited mimicry for which the answers are
not known. Firstly, female-limitation seems restricted to putative Batesian
mimicry. As far as is known, M&uuml;llerian mimics lack strong sexual dimorphism.
Presumably, this is explained because M&uuml;llerian mimicry is under purifying
density-dependent selection: as a mimetic pattern becomes more common,
its advantage increases (<a href="MimM&amp;JFig1.html">Fig. 1</a>). In contrast,
Batesian mimicry becomes less successful as it becomes commoner; thus sexual
selection is more likely to outweigh this weakening mimetic advantage in
Batesian mimics (162). Female-limited mimicry also seems virtually confined
to butterflies (46, 168), whereas the sexual selection theory should apply
to all examples of Batesian mimicry. Here, the explanation may be ecological.
Territorial or fighting males of many butterflies fly purposefully, fast,
and can escape predators easily. Female butterflies searching for oviposition
sites can be particularly vulnerable to predator attacks (111) because
they must fly slowly, like potential models; thus ecological considerations
may explain why butterfly females, but not males, often mimic slow-flying
models (111, 169). Ecological constraints on sexually dimorphic mimicry
are well demonstrated by cases in which only the male is mimetic (168),
for example, in saturniid moths with nocturnal females but diurnal males
(172).
<br>&nbsp;
</p><p><i>Mimetic Polymorphism and Genetic Architecture</i>
</p><p>Batesian mimetic butterflies may be polymorphic as well as sexually
dimorphic. This phenomenon is best known and studied genetically among
female mimetic forms of Papilionidae, particularly <i>Papilio dardanus</i>
and <i>P. memnon</i>, where each female form mimics a different unpalatable
model. The maintenance of this polymorphism is easily explained in common
Batesian mimics because frequency-dependent selection favors rare mimics.
Polymorphisms in Batesian mimics are also well-known in non-butterfly groups:
good examples exist in hoverflies (170-171). However, the rarity of accurate
polymorphic mimicry of the kind displayed in <i>Papilio </i>suggests that
special circumstances must be involved. Mimetic polymorphisms in these
cases are usually determined at relatively few genomic regions with large
effect ("supergenes"), often with almost complete dominance (38-39, 134-135).
The maintenance of mimetic polymorphisms probably depends rather strongly
on supergene inheritance. Without it, non-adaptive intermediates would
be produced.
</p><p>While it is easy to understand the maintenance of polymorphisms at mimetic
supergenes, it is far from clear how these supergenes initially evolved.
Early Mendelians used these genetic switches as evidence that mutations
of major effect were prime movers of adaptation (123). Fisher (49) argued
forcefully that most adaptive evolution could be explained via multiple
genetic changes of individually small effect being sorted by natural selection
(49). Essentially, Fisher proposed that selection rather than mutation
was the creative process in adaptation. Goldschmidt (56) then revived mutationist
theory in more sophisticated form, and proposed that mimics could exploit
major ("systemic") mutations which re-used the same developmental machinery
originally exploited by the model. He felt it unlikely that the same genes
were re-used by mimics and models, proposing instead that different genes
had access to the same developmental pathways. Gradualists were quick to
point out cases in which development of mimicry was clearly analogous rather
than homologous; such as colored spots on the head and body of models being
mimicked by basal wing patches on mimetic <i>Papilio memnon</i> (135).
Single gene switches in <i>P. memnon</i> were demonstrated to consist of
tightly-linked multiple genetic elements that could be broken apart by
recombination or mutation, and it was suggested by gradualists that these
"supergenes" had been gradually constructed by a process of linkage tightening
to reduce the breakup of adaptive combinations by recombination (38-39).
</p><p>More recently, opinion has swung back (but only part way) towards a
more middle-ground mutationist viewpoint. It has been realized that it
would be hard to construct supergenes by means of natural selection alone.
Separate elements of a supergene must have been tightly linked initially
in order that a sufficiently high correlation between favorable traits
was available for selection for tighter linkage. Thus the genetic architecture
of mimicry must to some extent consist of pre-existing gene clusters. If
so, this could explain why M&uuml;llerian mimics and models such as <i>Heliconius</i>
often themselves show major gene inheritance. M&uuml;llerian mimics are
not expected to have polymorphisms, and usually they do not (but see below
under <i>M&uuml;llerian mimicry</i>), thus they are not expected to require
supergene inheritance of their color patterns under the gradualist hypothesis.
<i>Heliconius</i>
patterns are inherited at multiple loci: this was interpreted as confirming
a gradualist expectation for polygenic inheritance of mimicry (113, 137,
164). However, a closer look at <i>Heliconius</i> shows that many of the
pattern switches are indeed major, have major fitness effects, and can
also in some cases be broken down into tightly linked component parts by
recombination or mutation (87a, 93, 137), again suggesting mimetic "supergenes".
For example, in both M&uuml;llerian mimics <i>H. erato</i> and <i>H. melpomene</i>,
a large forewing orange patch known as "dennis", and orange hindwing "ray"
patterns are very tightly linked, but are separable via rare recombination
or mutations which show up only in rare individuals from hybrid zones (87a).
Probably, mutations with major effect are required even in M&uuml;llerian
mimicry because, during adaptation, a M&uuml;llerian mimic loses its current
warning pattern while approaching that of a model. There is thus a phenotypic
fitness trough between the old pattern and the new pattern. Only if a mutation
produces instant protection by the new pattern can the gene be favored,
unless the two patterns are already extremely close. After approximate
mimicry has been achieved by mutation, multilocus "modifiers" can improve
the resemblance in the normal way (37, 105, 161, 164). This hybrid view
of M&uuml;llerian mimicry, known as the Nicholson "two-step" theory, combines
what is arguably a mutationist argument with a gradualist hypothesis to
explain the perfection of resemblances.
</p><p>This explanation fits major gene adaptations in M&uuml;llerian mimicry,
especially as it is now realized that Fisher's argument for adaptation
via small mutations has serious flaws (112), even without the frequency-dependent
stability peaks of mimicry (<a href="MimM&amp;JFig1.html">Fig. 1</a>). However,
two-step theory cannot explain why genes for forewing and hindwing patterns
should be tightly linked in both model and mimic in <i>Heliconius</i>.
Why should
<i>H. erato</i> and
<i>H. melpomene </i>(the former is almost
certainly the model driving the divergence -- see 55, 89) <i>both </i>diverge
geographically using probable supergenes of major genetic effect? One possibility
is that genetic architecture for color pattern change in <i>Heliconius</i>
simply has limited flexibility (87a). We now know that there is widespread
re-use of homeotic gene family machinery throughout the animal kingdom,
including some involvement in color pattern development in butterflies
(16, 33). It would not be surprising if mimicry gene families were not
also re-used similarly (106-108, 164) in the lineages leading to <i>H.
erato</i> and <i>H. melpomene</i>. This argument is similar to Goldschmidt's
(56), but in one sense more extreme, since Goldschmidt thought it likely
only that the same patterning control would be reused, rather than the
very same genes. Others argue from similar data that the evidence is in
favor of analogous rather than homologous developmental pathways and gene
action (88), but a true test will be possible only when mimicry genes are
characterized at the molecular level in both lineages (51, 95).
</p><p>In conclusion, current opinion based on nearly a century of genetic
studies and mathematical population genetic theory shows how mimetic as
well as other adaptations may often require mutations of major effect,
at least initially, both because of the ruggedness of the selective landscape,
and probably also because of constraints imposed by pattern genetics. Perfection
of these adaptations then involves effects generated at multiple genes
of increasingly small effect. The types of genetic architecture required,
especially for polymorphic mimicry, may be rare. This may explain why some
groups involved in mimicry, such as the Papilionidae, are able to colonize
multiple mimicry rings (164), while others are rarely mimetic. Disruptive
mimetic selection is perhaps as likely to be an agent causing an alternative,
speciation, as it is to be a common cause of polymorphism (see <i>Mimicry
and Speciation</i> below).
<br>&nbsp;
</p><p><i>M&uuml;llerian Mimicry, Polymorphism and the Palatability Spectrum</i>
</p><p>M&uuml;llerian mimicry and warning color are standard textbook examples
of frequency-dependent selection within species (e.g. 99, 126) as well
as leading to M&uuml;llerian mimicry between species (103). Polymorphisms
should be rare due to high rates of attack on rare variants (<a href="MimM&amp;JFig1.html">Fig.
1</a>; 27, 47, 67, 87, 89). In general, workers in the field of mimicry
assert that this is so (89, 97-98, 161, 164, 167), but there are some very
embarrassing exceptions to the rule among even the best known M&uuml;llerian
mimics. The most famous case is <i>Danaus chrysippus</i> and its M&uuml;llerian
mimics <i>Acraea encedon</i>, <i>A. encedana</i>, together with their Batesian
mimic <i>Hypolimnas misippus</i>. While distinct color patterns are virtually
fixed in the peripheries of their respective ranges, these species are
highly polymorphic over an area of Central and Eastern Africa larger than
Europe (57, 146). Similarly embarrassing widespread polymorphisms are found
in two-spot ladybirds (15, 85), and in <i>Laparus doris</i> (Heliconiinae)
(151, 159). Arguably, mimicry in many of these cases is weak: non- or poorly
mimetic morphs are common (114, 85, 143-144, 159). However, there are equally
problematic examples in which mimicry is very accurate. For instance, <i>Heliconius
cydno</i> is mostly monomorphic in Central America (94, 142), but becomes
polymorphic throughout much of the Andes of Colombia and W. Ecuador (80,
83); each morph can be clearly identified as an accurate mimic of other
<i>Heliconius</i>,
particularly <i>H. sapho</i> and <i>H. eleuchia</i>. The pinnacle of M&uuml;llerian
mimetic polymorphism is found in <i>Heliconius numata</i>. This species
is polymorphic throughout virtually its whole range, and some populations
of the Amazon basin near the slopes of the Eastern Andes may have up to
7 different morphs, each of which is an accurate mimic of a separate species
of ithomiine in the genera <i>Melinaea</i> or <i>Mechanitis</i> (23, 26).
Three general explanations have been proposed.
</p><p>1) <i>Batesian Overload and Coevolutionary Chase. </i>If an unpalatable
species has many Batesian mimics, it may suffer from "Batesian overload".
According to this hypothesis, the deleterious effects of mimics may force
the model to diverge from its normal pattern to escape mimicry, leading
to a coevolutionary chase of model by mimic. This idea has generated some
controversy (54, 71, 72, 109, 165), but has been well reviewed recently
(164, 165), and we merely summarize: it does not seem likely that coevolutionary
chase or Batesian overload can explain polymorphisms in unpalatable models.
Frequency-dependent purifying selection on the models is almost always
stronger than diversifying selection imposed by mimetic load (57, 78, 109,
165).
</p><p>2) <i>The Palatability Spectrum</i>. Unpalatability cannot be absolute;
there must be variation in unpalatability, which could lead to some interesting
evolutionary effects. M&uuml;llerian and Batesian mimicry are differentiated
by means of palatabilities: models and M&uuml;llerian mimics are negatively
reinforcing, while Batesian mimics positively reinforce predator attacks.
Hence we obtain the straightforward view that Batesian mimics are parasitic
- they hurt their models, while M&uuml;llerian mimics are mutualistic and
benefit their models (103). However, a second equally straightforward idea
apparently conflicts with this view: if two M&uuml;llerian mimics are not
equally unpalatable, the presence of the more palatable could increase
the rate of attack on the less palatable, so that unpalatable mimics may
harm their models or co-mimics, leading to a parasitic form of M&uuml;llerian
mimicry. A series of behavioral modellers since the 1960s have suggested
that parasitic M&uuml;llerian mimicry may explain some of the embarrassing
examples of polymorphism in aposematic species. Because benefits and costs
become decoupled from the M&uuml;llerian/Batesian palatability divide in
this latter prediction, a new terminology must be developed. An appropriate
name for the new parasitic form of M&uuml;llerian mimicry is "quasi-Batesian"
(148). [There is also a category of palatability-defined Batesian mimicry
which is beneficial to the model as well as the mimic; "quasi-M&uuml;llerian"
mimicry. This is possible if seeing a palatable mimic "jogs" the memory,
reminding predators of unpleasant experiences with the model, and leading
to greater avoidance of the model than if there were no mimic. Quasi-M&uuml;llerian
mimicry seems unlikely (151); anyway, it should not lead to polymorphism
and will not be discussed further.] In quasi-Batesian mimicry, the more
palatable mimic may suffer increasing attacks as its numbers increase relative
to the model's, even though its effect while alone would be to reduce its
predation progressively as density increases (<a href="MimM&amp;JFig3.html">Fig.
3</a>B,C) (71, 72, 115, 148-151). This has been suggested to lead to the
evolution of polymorphism in M&uuml;llerian mimicry systems (71-72, 148-151).
</p><p>The behavioral assumptions that lead to quasi-Batesian mimicry pose
a severe threat to traditional natural history and evolutionary dynamics
views of mimicry, possibly "the end of traditional M&uuml;llerian mimicry"
(148). This problem never arose until behaviorists attempted to model memory
realistically. It is apparent that M&uuml;ller and subsequent naturalists
and evolutionists made an unstated assumption: that the sum of learning
and forgetting over all predators would cause an approximately constant
number (<i>n<sub>k</sub></i>) of unpalatable individuals of each phenotype
to be killed (or damaged) per unit time (<a href="MimM&amp;JFig1.html">Fig.
1</a>). Purifying frequency-dependent selection results from M&uuml;ller's
assumption because the average attack fraction <i>n<sub>k</sub></i>/<i>N</i>
decreases as the total number of individuals, <i>N</i> increases. The existence
of quasi-Batesian mimicry, in contrast, requires that the attack fraction
on a M&uuml;llerian mimic increases as <i>N</i> increases, implying that
<i>n<sub>k</sub></i>
can be a rising function of <i>N</i> rather than a constant. We will here
follow the development of these ideas, and discuss why we feel the assumptions
that lead to quasi-Batesian mimicry may not be met in most real situations.
</p><p>The original idea for what is now called quasi-Batesian mimicry was
proposed by Huheey (71 and earlier). After a single trial experience with
an unpalatable individual, the predator was imagined to learn to avoid
totally; thereafter the predator would forget after seeing, but not attacking,
a fixed number of individuals with the same pattern. In this formulation,
unpalatability affected only the rate of memory loss, rather than its acquisition:
very unpalatable species caused slower forgetting than mildly unpalatable
species. Increasing the density of less nasty mimics caused a rise in the
average forgetting rate and led to an increasing fraction of models attacked
(<a href="MimM&amp;JFig3.html">Fig. 3</a>B). Thus, if two unpalatable species
differed in palatability, only one benefited, while the other suffered,
though the more palatable species on its own was still unpalatable in the
sense that predators are negatively reinforced. Even mimicry at the point
of equal palatability was neutral, in that increases in density of either
caused a faster rate of both acquisition and loss of memory, rather than
a reduction in fraction attacked. The predicted absence of mutualistic
mimicry in Huheey's theory was strongly attacked (12, 114, 136, 151). The
problem appeared to be the event-triggered forgetting model, in which avoidance
lapsed after a certain number of prey were avoided. This meant that the
total number of prey in the population had no effect on the evolution;
selection was assumed to depend only on frequency.
</p><p>To avoid this pathology of Huheey's formulation, it was proposed that
forgetting should be time-dependent (12, 114, 136, 166), rather than depending
on the number of avoidances; forgetting should cause the attack fractions
to decline or rise exponentially with rates&nbsp;<img src="alpha.gif" height="20" width="10" align="texttop"><sub>Mi</sub>
and&nbsp;<img src="alpha.gif" height="20" width="10" align="texttop"><sub>Mo</sub>
(for mimic and model respectively) towards the "naive attack rate", i.e.
naive attack fraction (115, 149). At the same time, a more flexible system
of learning was proposed, in which unpalatability was represented as an
asymptotic fraction of prey attacked,&nbsp;<img src="lambda.gif" height="20" width="10" align="texttop"><sub>Mi</sub>
and&nbsp;<img src="lambda.gif" height="20" width="10" align="texttop"><sub>Mo</sub>;
these asymptotes were again approached exponentially, with learning rates
forming another set of parameters (115, 151). These theories could reproduce
the full spectrum of mimicry from Batesian mimicry (<a href="MimM&amp;JFig3.html">Fig.
3</a>A) to M&uuml;llerian mimicry (<a href="MimM&amp;JFig3.html">Fig. 3</a>D),
including quasi-Batesian mimicry (<a href="MimM&amp;JFig3.html">Fig. 3</a>B),
and also a curious form of bimodal mimicry which is quasi-Batesian at low
mimic density, but traditionally M&uuml;llerian at higher mimic densities
(Fig. 3C).
</p><p>The behavior of these models is easy to explain. Memory gain or loss
both result in exponential approach to an asymptote of attack frequency,
so the combination of the two processes will itself lead to a stationary
resultant attack fraction independent of density for either model or mimic
on their own. The joint attack fraction on model and mimic together (assuming
models and mimics are visually indistinguishable) is simply an average
between the curves for model and mimic asymptotic attack fractions. When
mimic density is very low, the joint response is very like that of the
model; when mimic density is high, the effect of the mimic dominates, and
the joint response increasingly obeys the mimic's asymptote. Because the
averaging process is of the form of a harmonic mean (115) rather than an
arithmetic mean, curious peaks in the density response can occur, the "Owen
&amp; Owen effect" (149) (<a href="MimM&amp;JFig3.html">Fig. 3</a>C), implying
a quasi-Batesian/M&uuml;llerian transition across a density threshold.
</p><p>Speed and Turner (151, 167a) recently examined the behavior of a number
of different formulations and combinations of these basic memory assumptions.
They concluded that (a) many of the assumptions produce quasi-Batesian
responses like that of <a href="MimM&amp;JFig3.html">Fig. 3</a>B-C; (b) that
behavioral experiments on mimicry and warning color are not usually set
up to test for density responses, and therefore cannot easily be used to
test whether mimicry falls into quasi-Batesian categories (167a). Well-known
polymorphic M&uuml;llerian mimics often have intermediate levels of acceptance
in tests both with caged and wild birds (20, 34-35, 77, 119-120, 132),
showing that many supposedly unpalatable species may often be attacked.
Therefore, the known biology of predation on unpalatable species as well
as theory mesh with the possibility of a palatability spectrum that could
lead to quasi-Batesian mimicry.
</p><p>However, if theories like those in <a href="MimM&amp;JFig3.html">Fig. 3</a>
are correct, the assumptions for traditional number-dependent and frequency-dependent
mimicry of Fig. 1 must be wrong. Our own belief is that new and incorrect
assumptions lurking in the behavioral models are to blame for the conflict.
Our criticisms are as follows:
</p><p>a) It seems unlikely that attack rates will reach an asymptotic <i>fraction
</i>independent
of density, unless that fraction is zero. To understand this, imagine that
forgetting is switched off, so that all learning is perfect. Under the
new theories (115, 148), learning should asymptote at a constant frequency;
number-dependence enters into memory dynamics only through time-based forgetting.
With no forgetting, there is then no number-dependent selection, and mutualistic
M&uuml;llerian mimicry becomes impossible if memory is perfect (149-151).
Intuitively, it seems odd that perfect memory does not lead to extremely
successful M&uuml;llerian mimicry, and this intuition is, we believe, correct.
The absence of M&uuml;llerian mimicry when there is no forgetting is due
to rapid attainment of asymptotic attack fraction. In other words, as the
density of an unpalatable mimic in Fig. 3 rises, the predator is supposed
to stuff itself with more and more unpalatable prey in order to maintain
a constant asymptotic <i>fraction</i> of prey attacked. Note that this
argument does not depend on "hunger levels", because unpalatable prey are
unlikely to form a large component of the diet (166). The argument is about
learning to avoid prey, which is more likely to depend on dose received
by the predator per unit time, rather than dose per individual prey. The
new theories in effect have the same problem for learning (i.e. not being
time-based) as the forgetting model for which Huheey was criticized (12,
115, 136). It seems much more likely to us that for "unpalatable" prey,
an asymptotic <i>number</i> of prey attacked per unit time would be required
for learning, leading to strongly number-dependent and frequency-dependent
selection like that of <a href="MimM&amp;JFig1.html">Fig. 1</a>.
</p><p>b) It is hard to justify the term "unpalatability" unless the effect
is density independent; predators should reject and increasingly avoid
unpalatable prey whenever they encounter them. However, the new theories
see a species as unpalatable if it has a learning asymptote lower than
the "naive attack fraction", and as palatable if it has a learning asymptote
higher than the naive attack fraction (149, 151). But only when the asymptotic
attack fraction is zero do we produce avoidance whatever the attack fraction
prior to each individual experience; this was the case, for example, in
an original simulation model designed to disprove Huheey's assertions,
and which recovered only Batesian and M&uuml;llerian mimicry, with a sharp
transition between them (166). If our argument is correct, the whole of
the palatability spectrum above an asymptotic attack fraction of 0 is then
"palatable", and "quasi-Batesian mimicry" simply becomes Batesian, parasitic
mimicry. The "palatability spectrum" represented by 0 &lt; asymptotic attack
fraction &lt;= 1 is just that, a spectrum of palatability rather than of
unpalatability.
</p><p>c) Another problem is that, strictly speaking, "attack fraction" is
not "palatability" at all, but a transformation of palatability onto a
behavioral axis. Unpalatability is likely related linearly, or perhaps
logarithmically, to dosage of particular noxious compounds. The effect
of these compounds may be to produce an asymptotic attack fraction of 0%,
100%, or somewhere in between (<a href="MimM&amp;JFig3.html">Fig. 3</a>). However,
the dosage response curve will certainly be sigmoidal, with most of the
dosages exhibiting approximately 100% (palatable) or 0% (unpalatable) asymptotic
attack, and a narrow intervening band of dosages giving rise to intermediate
levels of palatability. Thus, the "palatability spectrum" as modelled by
attack fraction is a highly distorted view of the underlying palatability,
or dosage, of noxious chemistry; in fact, most of the dosage spectrum is
not considered by these attack rate spectrum models (115, 148-151). In
reality, these intermediate asymptotic attack fractions, if they do exist
at all, are likely to be rare.
</p><p>Empirical data from caged and wild birds showing intermediate levels
of attack on models are of great interest, but they do not necessarily
conflict with the points made above: attack fractions in the laboratory
or in nature rarely tell us how they vary with prey density (167a). The
behavioral, "receiver psychology" view which leads to possibly novel forms
of mimicry suggests that the density response will asymptote; the number-dependent
(natural history) view predict that attack fractions on unpalatable insects
will always decline with increasing density. Unfortunately, experiments
have not clearly distinguished between these alternatives, because they
were rarely designed to check density responses (167a). It does not seem
impossible to design such experiments, however.
</p><p>In conclusion, theories of the palatability spectrum from a receiver
psychology angle have led to a potentially major upset in traditional views
of mimicry. To decide which view is correct, we need to understand memory
dynamics of actual predators, and, given that many of the controversial
theories are supposedly based on standard Pavlovian learning theory (124,
148), understanding the evolutionary results of memory on mimicry could
lead to advances in memory theory in general. Even if quasi-Batesian mimicry
turns out, as we believe, to be unlikely, the threat posed by these new
theories demonstrate the naivet&eacute; of the natural history assumption
that memory is a black box producing number dependence.
<br>&nbsp;
</p><p>3) <i>Spatial and Temporal Variation in Mimetic Selection</i>
</p><p>Geographic variation in mimetic color patterns within a mimic can obviously
be maintained by geographic divergence of models. If mimicry is M&uuml;llerian,
then divergence becomes self-reinforcing. Patches of habitat with different
M&uuml;llerian mimetic patterns will be separated by zones of polymorphism:
the width of the polymorphic region will be proportional to average dispersal
distance and inversely proportional to the square root of the strength
of selection (92), as for clines in general (5). Thus, if selection is
weak and dispersal extensive, bands of polymorphism may be wide compared
to areas of monomorphism. This situation undoubtedly pertains in many species;
for example, it is often not realized that it is a common situation within
<i>Heliconius</i>.
<i>Heliconius
erato</i> and <i>melpomene</i> are renowned for the narrowness of their
hybrid zones between strongly differentiated forms (e.g. 87, 93); however,
zones of polymorphism between weakly differentiated races, for instance
in the Amazon basin, are much broader, so that polymorphism is almost the
norm (see maps in 24, 27; many other maps of <i>Heliconius</i> races oversimplify
the actual distributions).
</p><p>A similar situation may exist for the unpalatable species <i>Acraea
encedon</i>, <i>A. encedana</i>, <i>Danaus chrysippus</i>, and their Batesian
mimic <i>Hypolimnas misippus</i> in Central and Eastern Africa: peripheral
populations of all these species are nearly monomorphic (146). Similarly,
spatially varying mimetic and other selection pressures, rather than quasi-Batesian
mimicry (151), may explain the polymorphisms of ladybirds such as <i>Adalia
bipunctata </i>(15, 85) and butterflies such as <i>Laparus doris</i> (159).
</p><p>A more complicated version of this idea has temporal as well as spatial
variation in mimetic selection. The diverse polymorphism of <i>Heliconius
numata</i> may be selected because the models (ithomiines in the genus
<i>Melinaea</i>)
vary greatly in abundance over time and space (26). However, it would be
hard to explain how polymorphism is maintained via temporal variation unless
the color pattern loci have, on average, a net heterozygote advantage.
Given that the supergenes affecting mimicry in <i>H. numata</i> are visually
dominant (26), any heterozygous advantage must usually be non-visual. Another
example of polymorphism in a M&uuml;llerian mimic with multiple models
is
<i>Heliconius cydno</i>. There are strong differences across W. Ecuador
in the frequency of models <i>Heliconius sapho</i> and
<i>H. eleuchia</i>,
causing divergent patterns of natural selection (80). In conclusion, the
observed polymorphisms of many M&uuml;llerian mimics can be explained without
quasi-Batesian mimicry, via spatial and possibly temporal variation in
model abundance.
</p><p>4) <i>The Shape of Frequency-Dependence.</i> The maintenance of polymorphism
in unpalatable species will be considerably aided by the shape of frequency-dependence,
given number-dependent selection (<a href="MimM&amp;JFig1.html">Fig. 1</a>).
When population sizes of prey (<i>N</i>) are large relative to the numbers
sacrificed during predator learning, the fraction <i>n<sub>k</sub></i>/<i>N</i>
will be small, say 1/100 or less, and there will be little selection in
the central polymorphic basin.
</p><p>Although we do not know the values of <i>n<sub>k</sub></i>/<i>N</i>
typical in the wild, a variety of experiments (11, 75, 80, 91) indicate
that selection can be strong, i.e. <i>n<sub>k</sub></i>/<i>N</i> &gt;= 1/10.
On the other hand, it seems likely that many predators will require few
learning trials to avoid an aposematic insect. Models and common M&uuml;llerian
mimics will often outnumber their predators considerably, and, furthermore,
predators live much longer and will often be able to generalize between
prey generations. Experiments by Kapan on <i>H. cydno</i> in W. Ecuador
showed that selection against polymorphism was much weaker where <i>H.
cydno</i> was abundant than where it was rare (80). Thus it seems not unlikely
that <i>n<sub>k</sub></i>/<i>N&lt;</i>=1/100, at least some of the time.
</p><p>Drift can explain the origin, but not the maintenance of polymorphism
in the central basin. However, polymorphisms, once attained, should be
only slowly removed via mimetic selection. Second order selective forces,
such as non-visual selection (for instance thermal selection in ladybirds),
arbitrary mate choice or other factors (15, 85, 144-147) may become important,
and contribute to non-adaptedness of mimetic polymorphisms. Strong selection
at some times and places (<i>n<sub>k</sub></i>/<i>N</i> = 1/10 or greater)
is clearly required to produce near-perfect resemblance and narrow hybrid
zones between races. But if a M&uuml;llerian mimic or model, perhaps by
an ecological fluke, becomes abundant relative to its predators (<i>n<sub>k</sub></i>/<i>N</i>
&lt;= 1/100), it could then be relatively free to experiment with non-adaptive
and polymorphic color patterns. In short, the shape of frequency-dependence,
together with varying selection for mimicry and mild selection of other
types can explain M&uuml;llerian polymorphism without the need for quasi-Batesian
mimicry.
<br>&nbsp;
</p><p>MIMICRY AND SPECIATION
</p><p>Bates, Wallace, and Darwin were all of the opinion that strong natural
selection, which must occur sometimes to explain mimicry, could lead to
speciation. The continuum between forms, races and species of diversely-patterned
tropical butterflies led to this idea in the first place (6-7, 173-174).
This view has since faded into the background, probably because of a post-war
concentration on reproductive characteristics ("reproductive isolating
mechanisms") thought important in speciation under the "biological species
concept" (100). However, mimicry can cause strong selection against non-mimetic
hybrids or intermediates, and should therefore contribute strongly to speciation
and species maintenance, by acting as a form of ecologically mediated post-mating
isolation, as in <i>H. himera</i> and <i>H. erato</i> (96, 101).
</p><p>If mimicry contributes to speciation, mimetic shifts should often be
associated with speciation within phylogenies. Mimicry-related speciation
would explain the curious pattern of "adaptive radiation" in <i>Heliconius</i>:
M&uuml;llerian co-mimics are usually unrelated, while closely related species
almost always belong to different mimicry rings (164). Mimetic pattern
has been switched between eight of nine pairs of terminal sister taxa in
a mtDNA phylogeny of <i>Heliconius</i>, (17, 95). Many sister taxa that
have switched mimicry are known from other groups as well. For example,
among butterflies, the viceroy (<i>Limenitis archippus</i>) mimics queen
and monarch butterflies (<i>Danaus</i> spp.), while its close relative,
the red-spotted purple (<i>Limenitis arthemis astyanax</i>) mimics an unpalatable
papilionid, <i>Battus philenor</i>. The two <i>Limenitis</i> are very closely
related, and hybridize occasionally in the wild (127). Similar examples
exist in the Papilionidae. According to Dr. F. Sperling (in litt.), it
does not seem that mimetic lineages speciate more rapidly in the genus
<i>Papilio</i>
than non-mimetic lineages; however, a number of closely related species
do differ in their mimicry ring.
</p><p>Nonetheless, while we believe mimicry undoubtedly contributes to speciation,
this section must remain somewhat speculative. We cannot point to any convincing
case in which mimicry has been the major or only cause of speciation. But
then perhaps speciation is almost always caused by multiple, rather than
single episodes of disruptive selection.
<br>&nbsp;
</p><p>EVOLUTION AND MAINTENANCE OF MULTIPLE MIMICRY RINGS
</p><p>A naive view of M&uuml;llerian mimicry would suggest that all similarly
sized species should converge locally onto a single color pattern. In fact,
there are often ten or more mimicry rings among ithomiine and heliconiine
butterflies of the Amazon basin (6, 9, 102, 137). The reason for the lack
of a single uniform mimicry ring among similarly sized butterflies is currently
disputed, and parallels, at an interspecific level, the debate on M&uuml;llerian
polymorphisms.
</p><p>Papageorgis (116) provided data from Peru showing that different heliconiine
and ithomiine mimicry rings fly at different heights in the forest canopy.
She suggested that dual selection for camouflage and mimicry might explain
these patterns. In other words, particular mimicry rings are better camouflaged
in the lighting conditions pertaining at their favored flight heights.
However, heliconiine flight heights are now well-documented to overlap
far more extensively than appeared from Papageorgis' data, although weak
mimicry associations do exist for habitat and nocturnal roosting height
(25, 28, 94). It is unclear how dual selection would work, and is anyway
hard to imagine that the garish reds, yellows, blacks and iridescent blues
of heliconiines are ever very cryptic against subdued forest backdrops.
</p><p>Nonetheless, recent studies of ithomiines, in contrast, do demonstrate
some patterning of mimicry rings in flight height as well as in horizontal
(habitat-related) distribution (10, 25, 44, 102). A possible explanation
for these community patterns is that different guilds of predators are
found preferentially in the different habitats or micro-habitats, so that,
within each habitat, mimicry is tuned to local predator knowledge (10,
94). There must be some selection pressure of this sort to explain the
multiple patterns; however, it would be hard to imagine birds ignoring
butterflies a metre or two higher or lower than their normal flight height
in the forest understory, and it seems highly unlikely that the proposed
sub-communities of predators and particular mimicry rings are very discrete.
The overlap between mimicry rings is rather more noticeable to the naturalist
than the rather statistical differences in average heights or habitats
of mimicry rings (10, 25, 44, 94, 102). Instead, some segregation may exist
because newly invading unpalatable species are most likely to join the
mimicry rings already most prevalent in their habitats. Major mimicry rings
that overlap substantially may be unlikely to join together as species
accumulate in each ring for the same reason that intraspecific polymorphisms
have a nearly neutral central basin (<a href="MimM&amp;JFig1.html">Fig. 1</a>):
the selection for convergence of two abundant mimicry rings will simply
not be that strong.
<br>&nbsp;
</p><p>CONCLUSIONS: MIMETIC DIVERSITY AND THE FORM OF FREQUENCY DEPENDENCE
</p><p>We have shown that the shape of number-dependent selection on the color
patterns of unpalatable species can help to explain many puzzling and mutually
conflicting data of mimicry and mimetic diversity. When the attack fraction
is high because of a high predator/prey ratio, selection on mimicry can
clearly be extremely strong and has been measured to be so in a handful
of field studies. But when predator/prey ratios are low (<i>n<sub>k</sub></i>/<i>N</i>
~ 1/100), there is a wide central basin of near neutrality where only weak
purifying selection acts on polymorphisms. Therefore, once an unpalatable
butterfly becomes abundant relative to predators, <i>n<sub>k</sub></i>/<i>N</i>
decreases hyperbolically, and its morphology becomes less constrained by
selection. Polymorphisms may then result which become relatively impervious
to further bouts of selection. The weakness of purifying selection in polymorphic
populations can help explain why puzzling polymorphisms in some M&uuml;llerian
mimics are not removed by selection. Such polymorphisms enable populations
to explore the selective landscape, which can increase the chances of shifting
balance, one of the few ways to explain why utterly novel color patterns
continually evolve in mimetic butterflies. Finally, partial responsibility
for a puzzling diversity of local mimicry rings can also be placed at the
door of weak selection against multiple rings when each ring is abundant.
</p><p>But these arguments will fail if predator memory and perception do not
produce number-dependent selection. If predators behave according to some
current theories of "receiver psychology", our conclusions based on more
traditional M&uuml;llerian theory may be invalid. We do not think that
this is the case; however, appropriate experimental studies are urgently
required to test between these models of memory and forgetting.
