<br><b>Figure 2. The theory of behavioral "peak shift".</b>
<p>If the appearances of palatable and unpalatable species are close to
each other along some stimulus dimension, such as conspicuousness, predators
may develop a perceptual bias which enhances discrimination, known by behaviorists
as "peak shift" (not to be confused with evolutionary "peak-shift" via
the shifting balance). The conflicting pressures on their perceptual/learning
system may lead them to avoid patterns brighter than the norm for the unpalatable
species more strongly than they avoid the normal pattern; conspicuous unpalatable
variants would then have an advantage over the normal pattern, allowing
gradual evolution of greater and greater conspicuousness of the unpalatable
species (arrow) (61). It is unclear how the palatable species will evolve;
it could be selected for mimicry (to the right), or to greater inconspicuousness
(to the left) to avoid detection, even though the latter may be costly
due to increased predator attack rate once detected.
