work done on </i>Anopheles<i> species at Mississippi State University,

1989-1992</i></font></font></font></h2></center>

<font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size="-1">In 1989-1992, Robert S. Fritzius,

myself, and several other helpers at Mississippi State, did a detailed

study of distribution, ecology, and insecticide resistance of the sibling

species then assigned to the species

<i>Anopheles quadrimaculatus</i>.&nbsp;

The work was supported as part of a USDA Cooperative States Research Service

special grant, the "Riceland Mosquito Management Program", consisting of

entomologists from a number of rice-growing states.&nbsp; The director

of the program was Dr. Jim K. Olson of Texas A&amp;M University.</font></font><font size="-1"></font>

<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size="-1">Publications from the Mississippi

State University component of RMMP were mostly in "grey literature". Eventually,

we hoped to publish our results in major journals, but because I left for

the UK and Bob Fritzius also left MSU soon afterwards, publication of our

data in peer-reviewed journals was never achieved.</font></font><font size="-1"></font>

</p><p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size="-1">Nonetheless, the results

of our work may be of interest to others in the fields of <i>Anopheles</i>

systematics, mosquito control and public health, and insecticide resistance.

I am therefore making these reports available here as fax-quality PDF files,

and some of the data as text files.</font></font><font size="-1"></font>

</p><p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size="-1"><i>A. Genetic differences

between members of the</i> Anopheles quadrimaculatus

<i>species group</i></font></font><font size="-1"></font>

</p><p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size="-1">In Mississippi, three sibling

species were identified on the basis of allozyme polymorphisms (<a href="rmmp89.pdf">Mallet

1989</a>); we used electrophoretic techniques originally developed by Greg

Lanzaro, and refined by Sudhir Narang, Paul Kaiser &amp; Jack Seawright

and others at the USDA Gainesville laboratory to identify the species.&nbsp;

An excellent review of their biology and taxonomy has been produced by

Reinert

et al. (1997), together with a complete list of references to all the available

literature.</font></font><font size="-1"></font>

</p>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size="-1">We used the letter species designations 
  current at the time in this group to delimit species. In 1989, we used allozyme 
  work to discover what we thought was a new species we called "C?" in Noxubee 
  Wildlife Refuge in <a href="rmmp89.pdf">1989</a>; this turned out to be "species 
  D" (later described as <i>An. maverlius</i>); the other two found in Mississippi 
  were "species A" (<em>An. quadrimaculatus</em> (<em>sensu stricto</em>)) and 
  "species B" (</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size="-1">later described 
  as <i>An. smaragdinus</i>)</font></font><font size="-1">.&nbsp;&nbsp; Eventually 
  detailed studies of morphological differences were done, and the known species

  between species of </i>Anopheles<i> in Noxubee Wildlife Refuge, Mississippi</i></font></font><font size="-1"></font> 
</p>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size="-1">We made a detailed examination

of <i>Anopheles</i> larvae across the water bodies in Noxubee Wildlife

Refuge, Noxubee County near Starkville, Mississippi.&nbsp; Brief conclusions

were: (1) <i>Anopheles punctipennis</i> is commoner in moving than in standing

water, in shady sites than in sunny sites, and later in the season than

earlier (<a href="rmmp91.pdf">Mallet 1991</a>).&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>Anopheles

punctipennis</i> also occurred early in the season in small roadside puddles

(which perhaps had been connected in small rivulets during rainy weather;

<a href="rmmp90.pdf">Mallet 1990</a>).&nbsp; (2) <i>Anopheles crucians</i>

is commoner in sunny sites in July and August than at any other time or

place.&nbsp; It differs little in its habitat preference to the <i>Anopheles

quadrimaculatus</i> species group (<a href="rmmp91.pdf">Mallet 1991</a>).&nbsp;

(3) The <i>Anopheles quadrimaculatus</i> group species are commoner in

still water in July and August than at other times (<a href="rmmp91.pdf">Mallet

1991</a>).&nbsp; (4) The different species within the <i>Anopheles quadrimaculatus</i>

group do not show any clear differences in larval microhabitat (Mallet

1991), although there are slight significant differences of frequency of

the three species in adult roosting collections in Noxubee (<a href="rmmp90.pdf">Mallet

1990)</a>.</font></font><font size="-1"></font>

</p><p><i><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size="-1">C. Estimate of the rate

of hybridization, and species concepts</font></font></i><font size="-1"></font>

</p><p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size="-1">We obtained mated females

from adult roosts in mixed populations of <i>An. quadrimaculatus</i>, <i>An.

smaragdinus</i> and<i> An. maverlius</i> in Noxubee Wildlife Refuge.&nbsp;

These were induced to lay eggs in small vials.&nbsp; The offspring, consisting

of many hundreds of broods of the three species, were analysed using allozymes.&nbsp;

The broods were always of the same type as the female, and never showed

evidence of being hybrids.&nbsp; If natural hybridization occurred, it

was extremely rare, and we did not detect any.&nbsp; The rate of hybridization

seems to be zero!</font></font><font size="-1"></font>

</p><p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size="-1">It may be of interest to

note that I was initially skeptical of the differences between the species

and suspected there might have been some electrophoretic artifacts involved

in their separation.&nbsp; (I was also interested in the possibility of

hybridization, which occurs between many other sibling species). As it

turned out, the differentiated allozyme loci in our three species mendelized

extremely well, and the genetic differences were real.</font></font><font size="-1"></font>

</p><p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size="-1">The fact that we could tell

species apart solely on the basis of gene frequency differences was a formative

event for me, and indeed was one of the data sets leading to my proposal

that species are readily identified as "genotypic clusters" (Mallet 1995).&nbsp;

That paper also cited Bob Fritzius' and my work on <i>Anopheles</i>. Today,

perhaps, "genomic clusters" would be a better term.</font></font><font size="-1"></font>

across the state of Mississippi, and the effect of gross habitat</i></font></font><font size="-1"></font>

</p><p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size="-1">We also carried out a survey

of

<i>quadrimaculatus</i> group species across the state of Mississippi

in <a href="mssadult90.txt">1990 (Fritzius 2002a)</a>, <a href="mssadult92.txt">1992

(Fritzius 2002b)</a>, and <a href="mssadult93.txt">1993 (Fritzius 2003)</a> and found strong differences in their distributions.&nbsp;

<i>An. quadrimaculatus</i> is the commonest, and is virtually the only

species found in the Mississippi Delta, where it is a major biting pest.&nbsp;

<i>An. smaragdinus</i> and <i>An. maverlius</i> are much more sporadic

in their distributions and are generally restricted to woods away from&nbsp;

human habitation (Mallet <a href="rmmp90.pdf">1990</a>,

<a href="rmmp91.pdf">1991</a>),

perhaps because of their susceptibility to insecticides (see <i>E </i>below).</font></font>

</p><p><i><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size="-1">E. Insecticide resistance</font></font></i><font size="-1"></font>

</p><p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size="-1">We tested adult <i>Anopheles

quadrimaculatus</i> group species for insecticide tolerance to insecticides

using a vial test invented by F.W. Plapp for rapid sampling of <i>Heliothis

virescens</i> (tobacco budworm).&nbsp; The test has the advantage that

individuals are tested separately; overcoming the non-independence of multiple

individual testing in the WHO tests. To ensure the correct species, we

tested many broods reared from adult mated females, induced to lay as above

(<i>C</i>), and for which we identified some members of the brood using

allozymes.&nbsp; We compared our results to the "Florida USDA" strain of

<i>An. quadrimaculatus</i> sensu stricto that had been in captivity since

the 1940s, long before widespread use of insecticide. The results can be

summarized as follows: (1) <i>An. smaragdinus</i> and <i>An. maverlius</i>

from Noxubee Wildlife Refuge are as susceptible to malathion and permethrin

as the Florida lab strain of <i>An. quadrimaculatus</i>.&nbsp; (2) Wild

<i>An. quadrimaculatus</i> sensu stricto, whether from the Mississippi

Delta or Noxubee, is highly resistant to malathion (about 10x - 1000x);

in fact it was hard to estimate LD50s to malathion in this species since

some individuals almost always survived our highest doses.&nbsp; (3) Delta

populations of <i>A. quadrimaculatus</i> sensu stricto are about 10x more

tolerant of permethrin than Noxubee populations of <i>An. quadrimaculatus</i>

sensu stricto (Mallet <a href="rmmp90.pdf">1990</a>, <a href="rmmp91.pdf">1991</a>,

<a href="mallet&amp;fritzius93.pdf">Mallet &amp; Fritzius 1993</a>).</font></font><font size="-1"></font>

</p><p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size="-1">This work suggests that malathion,

widely used in mosquito control in Mississippi, might be a very poor means

of control of the main pest mosquito, <i>An. quadrimaculatus</i>.&nbsp;

If <i>Anopheles smaragdinus</i> and <i>An. maverlius</i> were the pest

species, then malathion might be useful; but

<i>An. quadrimaculatus</i>

is the usual pest in Mississippi (<a href="mallet&amp;fritzius93.pdf">Mallet

&amp; Fritzius 1993</a>).</font></font><font size="-1"></font>

</p><p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size="-1">The work also suggests that

resistance to pyrethroids was evolving in <i>An. quadrimaculatus</i> to

about 10x in Mississippi Delta populations near Cleveland, Mississippi
