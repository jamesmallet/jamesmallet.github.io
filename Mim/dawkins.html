<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Author of many popular evolution 
  books, starting with <em>The Selfish Gene</em> (1976). In that first book, Dawkins 
  proposed a glorious metaphor to explain many counter-intuitive features of evolution 
  by natural selection, for example altruism: we bodies are mere vessels for the 
  sometimes dangerous schemes and strategies of our individual genes.&nbsp; To 
  an undergraduate in Oxford in 1975, he was an enormously inspiring teacher, 
  especially in his course &quot;Gene Machines&quot;, which promoted earlier versions 
  of the idea.&nbsp; </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">To Dawkins, the idea is not merely 
  a metaphor: he argues that selfish gene theory explains what evolution is &quot;for.&quot;&nbsp; 
  Today, this seems perhaps the wrong question: evolution to me isn't &quot;for&quot; 
  anything.&nbsp; Nonetheless, since then, many genuinely selfish genetic elements 
  have been discovered within genomes, and they are perhaps the major constituents 
  of many genomes -- this was completely unexpected back in 1975, and is a major 
  confirmation of the validity of Dawkins' idea. But selfish elements are themselves 
  checked by natural selection on the whole genome, and contribute little to whole-body 
  phenotypes. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">It is sometimes not helpful to view 
  genes as &quot;selfish,&quot; even as a metaphor -- in heterozygous advantage 
  for instance.&nbsp; The equilibrium allele frequency is easily understood to 
  include both allelic types because selection acts on the genotype as a whole; 
  we are not required to imagine a spurious &quot;collaboration&quot; between 
  the two alleles. It may therefore be better to view natural selection as acting 
  on phenotypes, rather than on individual genes: this makes the change in the 
  frequencies of alleles a non-tautological response to selection, rather than 
  conflating evolution with natural selection.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">As well as evolution, Dawkins today 
  single-mindedly promotes materialism and arguments against theism.&nbsp; His 
  book, <em>The God Delusion</em> (2006) attempts to debunk all religions and 
  promotes an uncompromising brand of atheism.&nbsp; He argues that religion is 
  to blame for many of today's problems in the public understanding of science, 
  conflict and terrorism world-wide.&nbsp; The book received a negative review 
  from evolutionist H. Allen Orr in the New York Times, provoking a vigorous debate 
  with Daniel Dennett, a fervent supporter of Dawkins.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Dawkins famously morphs into cartoon 
  form in the series South Park, where he appears in bedroom scenes with the fundamentalist 
  Christian and transvestite schoolteacher Mr/Ms Garrison. </font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The real Dawkins remarked on <a href="http://richarddawkins.net/">his 
  blog</a> about this: <em>&quot;I share neither </em>[Garrison's]<em> religious 
  nor his sexual persuasion (that&#8217;s an understatement), and I&#8217;m buggered 
  if I like being portrayed as a cartoon character buggering a bald transvestite. 
  I wouldn&#8217;t have minded so much if only it had been in the service of some 
  serious point, but if there was a serious point in there I couldn&#8217;t discern 
  it.&quot;</em> </font> 
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In the two-part series, Garrison, 
  after conversion to Dawkins' atheism, founds a new atheism movement which in 
  the distant future leads eventually to global war between different atheistic 
  cults. I thought it did make a serious point after all (though I hasten to add 
  I agree with almost everying in <em>The God Delusion</em>), and found it very 
  funny.&nbsp; Yet putting myself in his shoes, perhaps I understand why Dawkins' 
  own sense of humour was not tickled. </font>

  Travis might have been related, but maybe isn't.&nbsp; Here is a transcript:</font>

      <p><em><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Selfish Gene</font></em></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><em>Genes<br>
        Thanks for everything<br>
        You hung me out by my heart<br>
        You're just so selfish, gene<br>
        Yes you are</em></font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><em>Hey you<br>
        Threw it all away<br>
        By holding everything in<br>
        Hey gene! Don't rock the boat<br>
        When you can't swim</em></font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><em>With a perfect understanding 
        of the finer things in life<br>
        A quite alarming knack of knowing when to twist the knife<br>
        Oh-oh!<br>
        Selfish gene</em></font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><em>Here's to you<br>
        Who read everything<br>
        Left it out on the shelf<br>
        There's noone else to blame<br>
        Except yourself</em></font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><em>Well, a perfect combination 
        of good etiquette and charm<br>

      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><em>Well, I'm standing on my 
        own<br>
        And this house is not a home<br>
        So sad to see you go<br>
        Things are high, and things are low<br>
        And it's good to know you know<br>
        If you've got nowhere to go<br>
        Well, you could spend the night with me<br>
        There will be no guarantee that I'll be here</em></font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><em>In the morning<br>
        Or any time that you call<br>
        I hear you snoring, gene<br>
        Through the wall</em></font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><em>So hey<br>
        Here's to everything<br>
        To peace and love in our time<br>
        Aw, gene, the slate is clean<br>
        I guess we're fine</em></font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><em>Well I don't expect a miracle<br>
        Not asking you to change<br>
        If you can see me happy<br>
        Well, just look the other way<br>
        Oh-oh!<br>
        Selfish gene</em></font></p>
