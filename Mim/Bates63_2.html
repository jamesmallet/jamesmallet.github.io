<p>The species of mammals, birds, and insects found at Obydos are, to a great 
  extent, the same as those inhabiting the well-explored tract of country lying 
  along the seacoast of Guiana. No other locality visited in the Amazons region 
  supplied, among its productions, so large a proportion of Guiana forms. The 
  four monkeys already mentioned all recur at Cayenne. A general resemblance of 
  the species to those of Guiana is one of the principal features in the zoology 
  of the Amazons valley; but in the low lands a great number exist only in the 
  form of strongly modified varieties; indeed, many of them are so much transformed 
  that they pass for distinct species; and so they truly are, according to the 
  received definitions of species. In the somewhat drier district of Obydos, the 
  forms are more constant to their Guiana types. We seem to obtain here a glimpse 
  of the manufacture of new species in nature. The way in which these modifications 
  occur merits a few remarks. I will therefore give an account of one very instructive 
  case which presented itself in this neighbourhood. </p>
<p>p. 256:</p>
<p>The case was furnished by certain kinds of handsome butterflies belonging to 
  the genus Heliconius,<sup><a href="#N_1_">(1)</a></sup> a group peculiar to 
  tropical America, abounding in individuals everywhere in the shades of its luxuriant 
  forests, and presenting clusters of varieties and closely allied species, as 
  well as many distinct, better marked forms. The closely allied species and varieties 
  are a great puzzle to classifiers; in fact, the group is one of those wherein 
  great changes seem to be now going on. <br>
  <img SRC="melpomene_tiny.jpg" height=286 width=500 align=LEFT>A conspicuous 
  member of the group is H. Melpomene of Linnaeus. This elegant form is found 
  throughout Guiana, Venezuela, and some parts of New Granada. It is very common 
  at Obydos, and reappears on the south side of the river in the dry forests behind 
  Santarem, at the mouth of the Tapajos. In all other parts of the Amazon valley, 
  east- [p. 257:] ward to Par&aacute; and westward to Peru, it is entirely absent. 
  This absence at first appeared to me very strange; for the local conditions 
  of these regions did not appear so strongly contrasted as to check, in this 
  abrupt manner, the range of so prolific a species; especially as at Obydos and 
  Santarem it occurred in moist woods close to the edge of the river. Another 
  and nearly allied species, however, takes its place in the forest plains; namely 
  the H. Thelxiope of H&uuml;bner. It is of the same size and shape as its sister 
  kind, but differs very strikingly in colours: H. Melpomene being simply black 
  with a large crimson spot on its wings, whilst H. Thelxiope has these beautifully 
  rayed with black and crimson, and is further adorned with a number of bright 
  yellow spots. Both have the same habits. H. Melpomene ornaments the sandy valleys 
  in the forests of Obydos, floating lazily in great numbers over the lower trees; 
  whilst H. Thelxiope, in a similar manner and in equal numbers, adorns the moister 
  forest which constitute its domain. No one [p. 258:] who has studied the group 
  has doubted for a moment that the two are perfectly and originally distinct 
  species, like the hare and rabbit, for instance, or any other two allied species 
  of one and the same genus. The following facts, however, led me to conclude 
  that the one is simply a modification of the other. There are, as might be supposed, 
  districts of forest intermediate in character between the drier areas of Obydos, 
  &amp;c., and the moister tracts which compose the rest of the immense river 
  valley. At two places in these intermediate districts, namely, Serpa, 180 miles 
  west of Obydos, on the same side of the river, and Aveyros, on the lower Tapajos, 
  most of the individuals of these Heliconii which occurred were transition forms 
  between the two species.&nbsp;<img SRC="thelxiope_tiny.jpg" BORDER=0 height=290 width=500 align=RIGHT>Already, 
  at Obydos, H. Melpomene showed some slight variation amongst its individuals 
  in the direction of H. Thelxiope, but not anything nearly approaching it. It 
  might be said that these transition forms were hybrids, produced by the intercrossing 
  of two originally distinct species; but the two come into contact in several 
  places where these intermediate examples are unknown, and I never observed them 
  to pair with each other. Besides which, many of them occur also on the coast 
  of Guiana, where H. Thelxiope has never been found. These hybrid-looking specimens 
  are connected together by so complete a chain of gradations that it is difficult 
  to separate them even into varieties, and they are incomparably more rare than 
  the two extreme forms. They link together gradually the wide interval between 
  the two species. One is driven to conclude, from these facts, that the two were 
  originally one and the same: the [p. 259 is just the figure (below); p. 260] 
  mode in which they occur and their relative geographical positions being in 
  favour of the supposition that H. Thelxiope has been derived from H. Melpomene. 
  Both are nevertheless good and true species in all the essential characters 
  of species; for, as already observed, they do not pair together when existing 
  side by side, nor is their any appearance of reversion to an original common 
  form under the same circumstances. <br>
  <img SRC="melxthel_hz_tiny.jpg" height=842 width=500 align=LEFT>In the controversy 
  which is being waged among Naturalists, since the publication of the Darwinian 
  theory of the origin of species, it has been rightly said that no proof at present 
  existed of the production of a physiological species, - that is, a form which 
  will not interbreed with the one from which it was derived, although given ample 
  opportunities of doing so, and does not exhibit signs of reverting to its parent 
  form when placed under the same conditions with it. Morphological species, - 
  that is, forms which differ by an amount that would justify their being considered 
  good species, have been produced in plenty through selection by man out of variations 
  arising under domestication or cultivation. The facts just given are, therefore, 
  of some scientific importance; for they tend to show that a physiological species 
  can be and is produced in nature out of the varieties of a pre-existing closely 
  allied one. This is not an isolated case; for I observed, in the course of my 
  travels, a number of similar instances. But in the very few has it happened 
  that the species which clearly appears to be the parent coexists with one that 
  has been evidently derived from it. Generally the sup- [p. 261:] posed parent 
  seems to have been modified, and then the demonstration is not so clear, for 
  some of the links in the chain of being are wanting. The process of origination 
  of a species in nature, as it takes place successively, must be ever beyond 
  man's power to trace, on account of the great lapse of time it requires. But 
  we can obtain a fair view of it by tracing a variable and far-spreading species 
  over the wide area of its present distribution; and a long observation of such 
  will lead to the conclusion that new species in all cases must have arisen out 
  of variable and widely-disseminated forms. It sometimes happens, as in the present 
  instance, that we find in one locality a species under a certain form which 
  is constant to all the individuals concerned; in another exhibiting numerous 
  varieties; and in a third presenting itself as a constant form, quite distinct 
  from the one we set out with. If we meet with any two of these modifications 
  living side by side, and maintaining their distinctive characters under such 
  circumstances, the proof of the natural origination of a species is complete: 
  it could not be much more so were we able to watch the process step by step. 
  It might be objected that the difference between our two species is but slight, 
  and that by classing them as varieties nothing further would be proved by them. 
  But the differences between them are such as obtain between allied species generally. 
  Large genera are composed, in great part, of such species; and it is interesting 
  to show how the great and beautiful diversity within a large genus is brought 
  about by the working of laws within our comprehension. 
<p>p. 262:
<p>A few remarks on the way races are produced will be here in place. Naturalists

have been generally inclined to attribute the formation of local varieties

or races of a species to the direct action of physical conditions on individuals

belonging to it which have migrated into new localities. It might be said,

therefore, that our Heliconius Thelxiope of the moist forests had resulted

from operation of the local conditions on H. Melpomene, especially as intermediate

varieties are found in districts of intermediate character and position.

<p>It is true that external agencies - such as food and climate, causing delayed 
  or quickened growth, - have great effect on insects, acting on their adolescent 
  states, and so by correlation of growth on the shape and colours of the adult 
  forms.<sup><a href="#N_2_">(2)</a></sup> But there is no proof that a complete 
  local variety or race has been produce wholly by this means, modifications acquired 
  by individuals not being generally transmissible to offspring. The examination 
  of these races or closely allied species of Heliconii, with reference to their 
  geographical distribution, throws light also on this subject. Thus Heliconius 
  Thelxiope is disseminated over a district 2000 miles in length from east to 
  west, from the mouth of the Amazons to the eastern slopes of the Andes, but 
  shows no remarkable modification throughout all that area; some slight variations 
  only occurring at extreme points of it. If local conditions [p. 263:] acting 
  directly on individuals had originally produced this race or species, they certainly 
  would have caused much modification of it in different parts of this region; 
  for the upper Amazons country differs greatly from the district near the Atlantic 
  in climate, sequence of seasons, soil, forest clothing, periodical inundations, 
  and so forth. These differences moreover graduate away so that the species is 
  subjected to a great diversity of physical conditions from locality to locality, 
  and ought in consequence to present an endless series of local varieties, on 
  the view mentioned, instead of one constant form throughout. Besides, how should 
  we explain the fact of H. Thelxiope and H. Melpomene both existing under the 
  same local conditions; and how account for the diversified modifications presented 
  in one and the same locality as at Serpa and on the Tapajos?<sup><a href="#N_3_">(3)</a></sup> 
<p>There is evidently therefore some more subtle agency at work in the segregation 
  of a race than the direct operation of external conditions. The principle of 
  natural selection, as lately propounded by Darwin, seems to offer an intelligible 
  explanation of the facts. According to this theory, the variable state of the 
  species exhibited in the districts above mentioned would be owing to Heliconius 
  Melpomene having been rendered vaguely instable by the indirect action of local 
  conditions dis- [p. 264:] similar to those where it exists under a constant 
  normal form. In these districts selection has not operated, or it is suitable 
  to the conditions of life there prevailing, that species should exist under 
  an instable form. But in the adjoining moister forests, as the result shows, 
  the local conditions were originally more favourable to one of these varieties 
  than to the others. The selected one, therefore, increased more rapidly than 
  its relatives; and the fact of the entire absence of these latter from an area 
  whence they are now separated by only a few miles, points to the conclusion 
  that they could not maintain their ground. Those individuals of successive broods 
  which were still better suited to the new conditions would for the same reasons 
  be preferred over their relatives; and this process going forward for a few 
  generations, the extreme form of H. Thelxiope would be reached. At this point 
  the race became well adapted to the new area, which we may suppose to have been 
  at that epoch in process of formation as the river plains became dry land, at 
  the last geological changes in the level of the country. In the higher and drier 
  areas of Guiana and the neighbouring countries, H. Melpomene has been the selected 
  form; in the lower and more humid regions of the Amazons, H. Thelxiope has been 
  preferred. An existing proof of this perfect adaptation is shown in the swarming 
  abundance of the species; the derivation of H. Thelxiope from H. Melpomene is 
  made extremely probable by the existence of a complete set of connecting links; 
  and lastly, its permanent establishment is made evident by its refusal to intercross 
  with its parent form, or revert [265:] to its former shape when brought by natural 
  redistribution into contact with it.<sup><a href="#N_4_">(4)</a></sup> 
<p><a NAME="N_1_"></a>1. This genus has long been known under the name

of Heliconia: a most inconvenient term, as a botanical genus bears the

same name. An author has lately proposed to revert to the masculine termination

of the words as first employed by Linnaeus (Felder, in the "Wiener Entomologische

Monatschrift," March, 1862), and, as I think the correction a good one,

I adopt it.

<p><a NAME="N_2_"></a>2. M. Bellier de la Chavignerie, in the "Annales

de la Soci&eacute;t&eacute; Entomologique de France, 1858," p. 299, relates

experiments to the effect of retardation of the pupa development through

exposure to unusual cold, showing that striking varieties of adult insects

are producible by this means.

<p><a NAME="N_3_"></a>3. As the action of external influences would be

on the early states of the insects and not on the adults, it is well to

mention that the broods of the Heliconii appear to be social; the larvae

feeding together and undergoing their last transformation on the same tree.

This I observed with regard to the H. Erato, a species closely allied to

H. Thelxiope.

<p><a NAME="N_4_"></a>4. If this explanation of the derivation of Heliconius Thelxiope

  be true, the origination by natural process of a host of now distinct allied

  species in this genus, as well as, in fact, all other genera containing numerous

  closely related species, will have to be admitted. A species allied to H. Thelxiope,

  namely H. Vesta, seems to have been derived also from H. Melpomene, for amongst

  the numerous varieties already mentioned are many examples of intermediate between

  the two. There is this difference, however, between H. Thelxiope and H. Vesta:

  the former is confined in its range to the Amazons valley, whilst H. Vesta extends

  beyond this region over Guiana and the central valleys of the Andes; it seems,

  therefore, to have acquired a power of adaptation to a much wider diversity

  of local conditions. Insects seem to be well adapted to furnish data in illustration

  of this interesting and difficult subject. This arises chiefly from the ease

  with which ample suites of specimens can be obtained for comparison from many

  points in the areas of distribution, both of species and of varieties. It is

  scarcely necessary to add that the conclusions thus arrived at will apply to

  all organic beings.
