shifting balance, Pleistocene refugia.
</p><p><i>Visual mimicry is a textbook case of natural selection because it
is both intuitively understandable and has repeatedly evolved in a variety
of organisms: it is the ultimate example of parallel evolution. In many
mimetic groups, particularly butterflies, a huge variety of colour patterns
has arisen, even in closely related species. This variety is a paradox
because, in its simplest form, mimicry is a theory of convergence that
should reduce diversity. There has been much recent controversy over explanations
of this variety. Mimicry is today a broad field of evolutionary study;
here we review only one aspect of mimicry, the evolution of its diversity,
and then only in predator-prey systems. Although mimicry is often presented
merely as an undergraduate showcase for Darwinian selection, it is a microcosm
for evolutionary theory in general, with ramifications into the evolution
of polymorphism, transitions between adaptive peaks, origins of biodiversity,
and the evolution and maintenance of community patterns.</i>
</p><p>The classical view of mimicry and frequency-dependent selection, found
in most undergraduate textbooks, is as follows: Predator aversion to the
appearance of warningly coloured or aposematic species is exploited byedible
prey, Batesian mimics, which evolve to resemble their models<sup>1,2</sup>.
Batesian mimics should lose protection when common: they hide among superficially
similar models, and hence are better off rare. Rare mimetic morphs should
be fittest because of this diversifying frequency-dependent selection,
leading to the possibility of stable polymorphism if several distinct models
are imitated by a single species. Conversely, aposematic models are best
protected when common (purifying frequency-dependent selection): rare or
new variants suffer the heaviest predation, because they are not recognized
as distasteful by predators. Unpalatable species are therefore expected
to be monomorphic. Purifying selection should also act across the species
boundary, leading to M&uuml;llerian mimicry where pairs of unpalatable
species benefit from mutual resemblance<sup>3</sup>, i.e. selection for
monomorphism at an interspecific level. Although still generally accepted,
these traditional ideas of frequency-dependent selection in Batesian and
M&uuml;llerian mimicry are now under strong attack.
</p><p><b>Polymorphism in Batesian mimicry</b>
</p><p>Polymorphism is often cited in textbooks as an important, almost diagnostic
characteristic of Batesian mimicry. However, although Batesian mimicry
seems fairly common (but see ref. 4), mimetic polymorphism is relatively
rare. The best-studied cases have all been swallowtail butterflies (Papilionidae)<sup>5-11</sup>,
where mimicry is often limited to females. As well as involving frequency-dependent
selection against common mimetic morphs, sexual dimorphism will also be
favoured by sexual selection<sup>7,8,11</sup> or preferential predation
on females<sup>9,12</sup> (<a href="http://www.ucl.ac.uk/taxome/jim/Mim/MimBox1.html">Box
1</a>).
</p><p>Why is Batesian polymorphism so rare? It could be that mimics are usually
strongly selected towards a single highly abundant or noxious model<sup>13,14</sup>.
Another likely explanation is that mimetic polymorphism requires a very
peculiar genetic architecture, i.e. a single mimetic &#8216;switch&#8217; gene or &#8216;supergene&#8217;
which very few species attain. The old idea that mimetic polymorphism evolved
via microevolutionary construction of a tightly linked supergene now seems
untenable. Batesian polymorphism requires that new colour genes are tightly
linked from the beginning. Unless this is so, tighter linkage will not
evolve because recombination will destroy the adaptive polymorphism before
it is stabilized<sup>6,15</sup><i>.</i> Most genetic architectures are
probably not suitable, resulting in mostly monomorphic mimicry from which
novel, poorly adapted mutants cannot escape. Batesian mimicry encounters
what Turner<sup>6</sup> calls an evolutionary &#8216;sieve&#8217; beyond which few
species will pass to become polymorphic.
</p><p><i>The coevolutionary chase</i>
</p><p>One of the main attributes of Batesian mimicry, and a reasonable part
of its definition, is that the mimic is deleterious to its model<sup>2,13,16,17</sup>.
The model could therefore escape its mimic by evolving a new warning pattern.
However, this escape is likely to be transient, because mutant models could
soon attract new mimics: a coevolutionary chase may result between models
and mimics, an evolutionary &#8216;arms race&#8217; similar to that in host-parasite
interactions<sup>2,18</sup>. Huheey<sup>16</sup> suggested a coevolutionary
chase could cause morph and race differentiation in models (e.g. <i>Heliconius
erato</i> and <i>H. melpomene</i>), eventually leading to the coexistence
of several mimetic patterns in a community. Similarly, although new hypotheses
are now being tested<sup>19</sup>, Smith <i>et al</i>.<sup>20</sup> explained
polymorphism in the distasteful <i>Danaus chrysippus</i> as an escape from
an overload of palatable <i>Hypolimnas</i> mimics. More recently, equations
for coevolution of a pair of mimetic species have been developed<sup>21</sup>,
which show that cyclical coevolution of model and mimic are possible if
interspecific interactions (i.e. benefit of mimicry to the mimic and cost
of Batesian mimicry to the model) are stronger than intraspecific interactions
(i.e. aposematism and palatability).
</p><p>We see two main reasons why coevolutionary chase is unlikely to drive
mimicry diversification. First, the evolutionary rate of the mimic should
be much higher than that of the model, because the mimic usually gains
more from mimicry than the model loses: thus a model cannot escape by evolving
a new pattern gradually because the mimic will quickly catch up<sup>6,22</sup>.
Second, since the model is the source of the protective (warning) colour
in the first place, it will be under strong purifying selection, and, as
in any aposematic system, rare variants are strongly disfavoured. A strong
constraint would thus prevent the evolution of novelty in the model, which
will be trapped in its own pattern. The model's only option will be to
become a M&uuml;llerian mimic in another more protected mimicry ring (<a href="http://www.ucl.ac.uk/taxome/jim/Mim/MimFig1.html">Fig.
1</a>) where it would gain immediate protection<sup>6,18</sup>, or, possibly,
to evolve a pattern via genetic drift that jumps out of the mimic&#8217;s reach.
</p><p>Faster evolution of the parasite is a general feature of host-parasite
systems, whose coevolution is thought to be one of the major forces driving
the evolution of higher organisms. In mimicry, although adaptation will
tie species together, the arms race will be severely slowed because of
the purifying frequency-dependent selection on the model<sup>18,22,23</sup>.
Coevolution will also be constrained because the model is usually commoner,
and so the interspecific effect of mimics on the model will be weaker than
the intraspecific effect of other model individuals. Mimicry will rarely
evolve past these sieves<sup>18</sup>, leading to unilateral, non-coevolutionary
mimicry, and stasis.
</p><p><b>M&uuml;llerian mimicry: why polymorphism?</b>
</p><p>Most unpalatable species are monomorphic as predicted by theory, apart
from in narrow hybrid zones between geographic races<sup>24,25</sup>. Yet,
some supposedly M&uuml;llerian mimics are polymorphic over extensive geographic
areas. Among classic but still unresolved examples are <i>D. chrysippus</i>
and <i>Acraea encedon/encedana</i> in Sub-Saharan Africa<sup>19</sup> and
<i>Heliconius
numata </i>in the Amazon Basin<sup>26</sup>. How can we explain this paradoxical
mimetic polymorphism under purifying selection?
</p><p><i>Importance of palatability and abundance</i>
</p><p>Similarity of a pair of distasteful species does not necessarily imply
M&uuml;llerian mimicry. Huheey (ref. 16 and earlier papers) held the radical
view that if species differ at all in unpalatability, the stronger suffers
from the presence of the weaker, which dilutes the unpalatability of the
mimicry ring. The mimetic relationship could then become effectively Batesian,
giving the potential for coevolutionary chase. M&uuml;llerian (mutually
beneficial) mimicry could then not exist except at the limit of identical
palatability. Huheey was roundly criticized<sup>27,28</sup>, in part because
his models predicted that mutualistic M&uuml;llerian mimicry could never
exist. Alternative models reaffirmed the traditional view of a sharp discontinuity
between Batesian and M&uuml;llerian mimicry<sup>17,29</sup>. However, less
unpalatable mimics could indeed, in theory, raise the probability of attack
on their more unpalatable models, and Speed<sup>13</sup> has rejuvenated
the argument that this could lead to polymorphism evolving in the mimic.
Because this type of M&uuml;llerian mimicry could be diversifying, the
effect has been termed quasi-Batesian<sup>13</sup> or Speedian<sup>18</sup>
mimicry.
</p><p>These ideas depend on revised assumptions about predator behaviour (see
below), but there are some evolutionary problems for quasi-Batesian mimicry.
Mortality and the nature of mimicry does not depend only on relative palatability;
mimicry is very strongly influenced by relative abundance<sup>3</sup> and
degree of resemblance<sup>30</sup>. M&uuml;ller long ago showed that the
relative benefits for a mimetic pair varies as the square of their relative
abundances<sup>3</sup> (<a href="http://www.ucl.ac.uk/taxome/jim/Mim/MimBox2.html">Box
2</a>). Suppose that species A is much more palatable than species B leading
to ten times as much asymptotic predation on A than on B when each is alone,
and at equal densities. The mimetic relationship would then be very unfair
because A induces more predation on B than vice-versa. A is then a potential
quasi-Batesian mimic of B<sup>13</sup>. Assume now that A is ten times
as abundant as B; predator encounters would involve A ten times as often
as B, so B will benefit 100 times more than A from sharing in the education
of predators (<a href="http://www.ucl.ac.uk/taxome/jim/Mim/MimBox2.html">Box
2</a>). Type A is then the &#8216;model&#8217;, even though more palatable than B.
This very powerful frequency-dependent effect will typically influence
the outcome of the mimetic association much more strongly than the merely
frequency-independent effect of relative palatability. Whether quasi-Batesian
mimicry<sup>13</sup> exists at all commonly will depend strongly on typical
patterns of relative abundance and colour pattern similarity<sup>30</sup>,
as well as on relative palatability.
</p><p><i>Importance of predator behaviour</i>
</p><p>The palatability of prey in evolutionary models is defined by the way
predators react<sup>31</sup>. Various types of learning have been assumed,
mostly tacitly, by the authors cited above, but how predators actually
learn is still unclear<sup>13,15,18,32</sup>. To investigate how predator
behaviour influences the outcome of mimicry, Monte Carlo simulations, incorporating
a range of possible theories of predator behaviour, were run<sup>32</sup>
(also Speed and Turner, unpublished). Palatability was assumed to be measured
by &#8216;asymptotic attack rate&#8217;, i.e. the proportion of individuals attacked
when local predators reach an equilibrium between learning and forgetting<sup>13</sup>.
A three-zoned mimicry spectrum &#8211; classical Batesian and M&uuml;llerian
mimicry separated by a quasi-Batesian mimicry zone &#8211; is predicted by many
parameter combinations, including those closest to current theories of
cognition and learning. Mildly unpalatable species (having, by Speed&#8217;s
definition, a non-zero asymptotic attack rate) behave like Batesian mimics
and may evolve towards polymorphism; only very strongly unpalatable species
will become M&uuml;llerian mimics with purifying selection on the model.
If these assumptions are correct, true M&uuml;llerian mimicry could be
rare.
</p><p>In Speed&#8217;s analysis<sup>13</sup>, the prey is unpalatable if the asymptotic
probability of predation is lower than the naive attack probability, set
arbitrarily to 0.5. It seems to us that a more sensible view of unpalatability
would be any palatability which reduces predation upon experience, regardless
of the naive attack rate. Only when the asymptotic probability of attack
reaches zero do we have this kind of unpalatability. Here, the degree of
unpalatability would affect only the rate of learning<sup>17</sup>. If
this criticism is fair, &#8216;quasi-Batesian&#8217; mimicry is actually normal Batesian
mimicry, explaining why it is evolutionarily Batesian!
</p><p>It also seems likely that intermediate asymptotes of predation rate
will be rare; this is consistent with some empirical results. For example,
birds respond non-linearly to the palatability spectrum of pastry baits<sup>17</sup>,
and asymptotic predation rates are often either near 0% or 100%, with a
sharp boundary between what a predator likes or tolerates and what it always
rejects<sup>2</sup>. Classical M&uuml;llerian and Batesian mimicry would
then be the most abundant types of mimicry<sup>17</sup>, with only a very
small parameter space in which quasi-Batesian mimicry is even possible<sup>13,16</sup>.
Clearly, it would be worthwhile designing new sets of experiments to investigate
whether intermediate rates of asymptotic predation on natural prey exist,
and, if so, how common they are.
</p><p><i>Spatiotemporal heterogeneity</i>
</p><p>Variations in relative abundance (<a href="http://www.ucl.ac.uk/taxome/jim/Mim/MimBox2.html">Box
2</a>) and distastefulness might change or even reverse respective roles
in mimicry: a M&uuml;llerian (or quasi-Batesian) mimic could itself become
a model if temporarily more abundant than the species it mimicks. This
may cause geographic variation in mimetic pattern<sup>6,25</sup> and dramatic
switches from diversifying to purifying number-dependent selection<sup>33</sup>
in the quasi-Batesian mimicry zone<sup>30,34</sup> (if such a zone exists).
The nature of the mimetic relationship can be variable in time and space;
it is &#8216;contextually defined&#8217;<sup>34</sup>. Can such environmental heterogeneity
select for stable polymorphisms and interspecific diversity of mimicry?
</p><p>Brown and Benson<sup>26</sup> explained the extraordinary diversity
of <i>Heliconius numata </i>colour patterns as an adaptation to a highly
unpredictable mimetic environment. In this unpalatable Amazonian species
there are up to 11 sympatric morphs in any one area, and about 38 morphs
over its whole range. Each sympatric morph mimics a separate species of
<i>Melinaea</i>
(Ithomiinae, tiger pattern mimicry ring, <a href="http://www.ucl.ac.uk/taxome/jim/Mim/MimFig1.html">Fig.
1</a>). <i>Melinaea</i> are clearly the models for <i>H. numata</i><sup>1,26</sup>
but are tremendously variable in abundance. Polymorphism in <i>H. numata</i>
is therefore explained as a bet-hedging strategy, which ensures survival
under an unpredictable mimetic environment. It is likely that spatial,
as well as temporal heterogeneity in model frequency contributes to the
stability of the <i>H. numata</i> polymorphism<sup>26</sup>. However, there
is no experimental evidence for this explanation<sup>35</sup>, and more
theoretical work is needed because it also seems possible that stochastic
variability should typically cause the eventual loss of all except one
morph in a locality.
</p><p>The relative abundances of sympatric morphs of the M&uuml;llerian mimics
<i>Acraea
</i>spp. and <i>D. chrysippus </i>in Africa also vary geographically. There
is little correlation between morph frequencies of these co-mimics, making
the putative M&uuml;llerian association between <i>Acraea</i> and
<i>Danaus</i>
difficult to understand<sup>20</sup>. The evolutionary chase explanation
(see above) was unconvincing, so Owen <i>et al.</i><sup>19</sup> recently
reassessed the mimetic relationship after <i>A. encedon</i> was discovered
to consist of two sibling species. They showed that <i>A. encedon</i> only
weakly follows the morph frequencies of the other two despite the resemblance
of some morphs<i>; </i>frequencies of <i>Acraea encedana</i> morphs, in
contrast, are closely correlated with those of <i>D. chrysippus</i>. Recent
contact in Eastern Africa of previously isolated geographic races has been
suggested as a non-adaptive cause of polymorphism in these species<sup>19</sup>.
</p><p><b>Geographic divergence and coevolution in M&uuml;llerian systems</b>
</p><p>M&uuml;llerian mimicry with mutual benefits, if at all common, seems
an excellent candidate for coevolutionary mutualism. A variety of colour
patterns may have codifferentiated from an ancestral pattern. Among classical
examples is the spectacular racial divergence in <i>H. erato</i>, mirrored
with amazing accuracy by <i>H. melpomene</i>. As these two species belong
to different phylogenetic groups within the same genus, coevolution is
a very tempting explanation for parallel race formation. Cladograms based
on knowledge of wing-pattern loci are almost identical in <i>H. erato</i>
and<i> H. melpomene</i>, as expected if the two species had strictly coevolved<sup>6</sup>.
However, recent evidence<sup>36,37</sup> suggests that <i>H. erato</i>
may have a different ancestral pattern from <i>H. melpomene</i>, and, in
any case, a concordant cladogram does not imply coevolution, because one
species could have colonized the other's pre-existing pattern diversity
using a similar route. Both species might be expected to have similar genetic
control of wing patterns simply because they are related, so that shared
branching patterns could result from common genetics rather than coevolution<sup>6,38</sup>.
To elucidate the evolutionary history of the pair, Brower<sup>36</sup>
sequenced mitochondrial DNA from both species. Mitochondrial consensus
trees of races are not concordant in the two species (<a href="http://www.ucl.ac.uk/taxome/jim/Mim/MimFig2.html">Fig.
2</a>), showing that <i>H. melpomene</i> and <i>H. erato</i> did not share
a common biogeographical history, and that at least some of the mimicry
was not coevolutionary.
</p><p>Turner<sup>6,25</sup> applies a non-coevolutionary model to race formation
in <i>Heliconius</i>: he argues that mimicry rings can differ geographically
in their ability to &#8216;capture&#8217; species because of &#8216;biotic drift&#8217; (stochastic
extinction or changes in relative abundance of aposematic species). Species
will thus undergo mimetic capture several times in their history, switching
pattern again and again, and consequently &#8216;radiating&#8217; into geographic races.
Coevolution is not invoked because each species switches rings independently
of less abundant co-mimics, and has a different model in each area; instead
M&uuml;llerian mimicry is seen as unilateral colonization by rarer mimics
of the protective pattern of more abundant models. This biotic drift leading
to intraspecific diversity could have been enhanced if the forest shrank
into small refuges, possibly during the last glaciation; refuges, although
not necessary for ring switches, could facilitate extinction or density
variation, and so accelerate race divergence<sup>25</sup>. Alternatively,
random genetic drift and the shifting balance within model species could
account for the local origination of new patterns<sup>24,25</sup>. Density
changes potentially leading to changes in selection via biotic drift will
also facilitate genetic drift. Once formed in a local area, an advantageous
pattern will spread via movement of clines. The shifting balance, although
apparently unlikely because it invokes genetic drift, provides a better
explanation than biotic drift for the emergence of completely novel colour
patterns in the context of purifying selection. Under biotic drift, the
pattern diversity should progressively collapse into a single mimicry ring
as more and more mimetic captures are effected.
</p><p><b>Community patterns</b>
</p><p>Poorly adapted hybrids between mimetic or aposematic forms will be selected
against. Thus a form of reproductive isolation results from the evolution
of new colour patterns. It therefore seems likely that mimetic diversity
will contribute to the origin of new species; indeed closely related species
often differ in their mimetic allegiance<sup>1,39</sup> (see also <a href="http://www.ucl.ac.uk/taxome/jim/Mim/MimFig1.html">Fig.
1</a>). Understanding the evolution of mimetic diversity could therefore
lead to a better understanding of how species evolve from local or racial
variants.
</p><p>The maintenance of a diversity of geographic races in aposematic species,
once they have evolved, is easily understood because of the strong purifying
selection on either side of steep hybrid zones that separate them<sup>24</sup>.
However, the commonest patterns locally should always be better protected,
so that all mimetic butterflies of similar size in an area should evolve
towards a single, local pattern. As mimetic captures occur, for example
when forests are fragmented, we might expect one or two patterns to be
increasingly reinforced, resulting in even more captures of M&uuml;llerian
(and Batesian) mimics leading, ultimately, to a single local mimicry ring.
</p><p>Nature seems to behave in a completely contrary way; there are abundant,
multiple mimicry rings within any area (<a href="http://www.ucl.ac.uk/taxome/jim/Mim/MimFig1.html">Fig.
1</a>). One possible explanation is that each mimicry ring is sustained
in a separate microhabitat. <i>Heliconius</i> mimicry rings often have
little or no diurnal flight stratification in the rainforest canopy<sup>40,41</sup>.
In contrast, there is some stratification of nocturnally roosting <i>Heliconius</i><sup>41</sup>,
and of the diurnal flight of ithomiine mimicry rings in upper Amazonian
Ecuador<sup>42</sup>. In <i>Heliconius</i>, different rings are dominant
in low second growth, tall secondary forest and primary forest<sup>41</sup>.
Habitat differences are also likely in ithomiines but have still to be
studied in detail<sup>42,43</sup>. This microhabitat structuring of mimicry,
which is correlated with the heights and habitat requirements of the host-plants
used by the butterflies<sup>42</sup>, could allow mimicry rings to remain
distinct provided that there are sets of predators in different habitats,
each of which perceives a different mimicry ring as the most abundant model<sup>41,42</sup>.
However, the major impression a naturalist obtains in the rainforest is
of extensive overlap of mimicry rings in flight height and habitat choice<sup>40-43</sup>.
This makes it highly dubious that butterfly communities experience sufficient
disruptive predation to maintain a stable mimetic diversity. Alternatively,
multiple mimicry rings could be maintained as a result of rapid evolution
of novel patterns (evidenced by rampant geographical variation), speciation,
and sympatry, countered only by slow, sieve-constrained mimetic convergence.
Under this interpretation, local mimetic diversity is a result of a dynamic
balance between pattern divergence, speciation, and mimetic evolution,
rather than because it is a stable community optimum. Which explanation
is correct is not yet clear.
</p><p><b>Mimicry: a general model for the evolution of diversity</b>
</p><p>A major barrier to understanding mimicry is a lack of field studies.
For example, there has perhaps been only a single series of appropriately
controlled field demonstrations of the advantage of mimicry<sup>44</sup>.
Visual mimicry is recognized by human eyes, yet birds see the world differently<sup>45</sup>.
Our ability to find mimicry shows that our perceptual systems must be fairly
similar to those of the predators causing mimicry, but the differences
may explain some of the apparently non-adaptive mimicry we find, for instance
in <i>D. chrysippus</i> and its mimics. It is also becoming apparent that
our understanding of learning is at such an early stage that we do not
know how it affects the evolution of mimicry. Oddly, mimicry still creates
almost as much controversy today as it did 135 years ago. The problems
that underlie the paradoxical diversity of mimicry are of great interest
not just for undergraduates, but also for students of evolution of all
ages. Mimetic organisms have undergone massive diversification where the
maintenance of <i>status quo</i> is expected. Mimicry therefore provides
us with an example of a general problem: the evolution of biological diversity
in the face of conservative constraints.
