        <td style="vertical-align: top;"><p><span style="font-family: helvetica,arial,sans-serif;">As 
            a young man, Wallace taught in the <a href="leicester/collegiate_sch4.html">Collegiate 
            School, Leicester</a>.&nbsp; While in Leicester, a chance meeting 
            with <a href="Bates63.html">Henry Walter Bates</a> in the public library 
            led to a close friendship, and to their plan for a joint expedition 
            to the Brazilian Amazon.</span></p>
          <p><span style="font-family: helvetica,arial,sans-serif;">Wallace on 
            species:</span></p>
          <blockquote></p>
            "In estimating these numbers [i.e. of species in different regions] 
            I have had the usual difficulty to encounter, of determining what 
            to consider species and what varieties. ... The rule, therefore, I 
            have endeavoured to adopt is, that when the difference between two 
            forms inhabiting separate areas seems quite constant, when it can 
            be defined in words, and when it is not confined to a single peculiarity 
            only, I have considered such forms to be species. When, however, the 
            individuals of each locality vary among themselves, so as to cause 
            the distinctions between the two forms to become inconsiderable and 
            indefinite, or where the differences, though constant, are confined 
            to one particular only, such as size, tint, or a single point of difference 
            in marking or in outline, I class one of the forms as a variety of 
            the other." 
            <p>"Species are merely those strongly marked races or local forms 
              which, when in contact, do not intermix, and when inhabiting distinct 
              areas are generally regarded to have had a separate origin, and 
              to be incapable of producing a fertile hybrid offspring.&nbsp; But 
              as the test of hybridity cannot be applied in one case in ten thousand, 
              and even if it could be applied, would prove nothing, since it is 
              founded on an assumption of the very question to be decided <tt>-</tt> 
              and as the test of origin is in every case inapplicable <tt>-</tt> 
              and as, further, the test of non-intermixture is useless, except 
              in those rare cases where the most closely allied species are found 
              inhabiting the same area, it will be evident that we have no means 
              whatever of distinguishing so-called "true species" from the several 
              modes of variation here pointed out, and into which they so often 
              pass by an insensible gradation."</p>

            species and speciation. </font></p>
          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Wallace, of course, had 
            independently discovered the principle of natural selection in 1858.&nbsp; 
            But he always revered Darwin, even though Darwin took most of the 
            credit after his book &quot;On the Origin of Species&quot; (1859). 
            Here is an interesting observation by Wallace, in 1809, on the occasion 
            of Darwin's centenary:</font></p>
          <blockquote> 
            <p>&quot;How strange it seems to us now, that, but for the fortunate 
              chance of a naturalist being wanted just when Darwin had passed 
              his examination, and professor Henslow being the person asked to 
              recommend one, he would almost certainly have become a clergyman; 
              in which case he would have been, no doubt, an admirable country 
              parson, but the &#8220;Origin of Species&#8221; would not have been 
              written...&quot;</blockquote>
