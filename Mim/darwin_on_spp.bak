<br>
p. 44 Beginning of Ch II.&nbsp; Variation under Nature<br>
"No one definition (of species) has as yet satisfied all<br>
naturalists; yet every naturalist knows vaguely what he means<br>
when he speaks of a species.&nbsp; Generally the term includes the<br>
unknown element of a distinct act of creation.&nbsp; The term<br>
"variety" is almost equally difficult to define; but here<br>
community of descent is almost universally implied, though it<br>
can rarely be proved."<br>
<br>
p. 47<br>
Practically, when a naturalist can unite two forms together by<br>
others having intermediate characters, he treats the one as a<br>
variety of the other, ranking the most common, but sometimes<br>
the one first described, as the species, and the other as the<br>
variety.&nbsp; But cases of great difficulty, which I will not here<br>
enumerate, sometimes occur in deciding whether or not to rank<br>
one form as a variety of another, even when they are closely<br>
connected by intermediate links; nor will the commonly-assumed <br>
hybrid nature of the intermediate links always remove the difficulty. ...<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hence, in determining whether a form should be ranked as<br>
a species or a variety, the opinion of naturalists having<br>
sound judgement and wide experience seems the only guide to<br>
follow.<br>
<br>
<i>Editorial note: The above sentence was used by Ernst Mayr <br>
(1982, The Growth of Biological Thought) to illustrate that <br>
Darwin didn't understand the true nature of species.&nbsp; <br>
The preceding discussion was omitted.</i><br>
<br>
<br>
p. 59<br>
Many of the cases of strongly-marked varieties or doubtful species<br>
well deserve consideration; for several interesting lines of argument,<br>
from geographical distribution, analogical variation, hybridism, etc.,<br>
have been brought to bear on the attempt to determine their rank. I<br>
will here give only a single instance,--the well-known one of the<br>
primrose and cowslip, or Primula veris and elatior. These plants<br>
differ considerably in appearance; they have a different flavour and<br>
emit a different odour; they flower at slightly different periods;<br>
they grow in somewhat different stations; they ascend mountains to<br>
different heights; they have different geographical ranges; and<br>
lastly, according to very numerous experiments made during several<br>
years by that most careful observer Gartner, they can be crossed only<br>
with much difficulty. We could hardly wish for better evidence of the<br>
two forms being specifically distinct. On the other hand, they are<br>
united by many intermediate links, and it is very doubtful whether<br>
these links are hybrids; and there is, as it seems to me, an<br>
overwhelming amount of experimental evidence, showing that they<br>
descend from common parents, and consequently must be ranked as<br>
varieties.<br>
<br>
Close investigation, in most cases, will bring naturalists to an<br>
agreement how to rank doubtful forms. Yet it must be confessed, that<br>
it is in the best-known countries that we find the greatest number of<br>
forms of doubtful value. I have been struck with the fact, that if any<br>
animal or plant in a state of nature be highly useful to man, or from<br>
any cause closely attract his attention, varieties of it will almost<br>
universally be found recorded. These varieties, moreover, will be<br>
often ranked by some authors as species. Look at the common oak, how<br>
closely it has been studied; yet a German author makes more than a<br>
dozen species out of forms, which are very generally considered as<br>
varieties; and in this country the highest botanical authorities and<br>
practical men can be quoted to show that the sessile and pedunculated<br>
oaks are either good and distinct species or mere varieties.<br>
<br>
p. 52 mid Ch II.<br>
From these remarks it will be seen that I look at the term<br>
species, as one arbitrarily given for the sake of convenience<br>
to a set of individuals closely resembling each other, and<br>
that it does not essentially differ from the term variety,<br>
which is given to less distinct and more fluctuating forms. <br>
The term variety, again, in comparison with mere individual<br>
differences, is also applied arbitrarily, and for mere<br>
convenience sake.<br>
<br>
p. 58 end Ch. II.<br>
<i>Editorial note: Interpretations of this section have <br>
been very influential in the debate about whether <br>
Darwin's book was really about speciation, in spite <br>
of its title.&nbsp; In the 1930s and 1940s, biologists' <br>
understanding of this section led to the attempt to<br>
formulate a "new species concept", later known as <br>
"the biological species concept". &nbsp;<br>
<br>
Mayr (1942, p. 147), for example: "It is thus quite <br>
true, as several recent authors have indicated, that <br>
Darwin's book was misnamed, because it is a book on <br>
evolutionary changes in general and the factors that <br>
control them (selection and so forth), but not a treatise <br>
on the origin of species".<br>
<br>
Mayr (1963, p.12)&nbsp; "Darwin succeeded in convincing <br>
the world of the occurrence of evolution and ... he <br>
found (in natural selection) the mechanism that is <br>
responsible for evolutionary change and adaptation.&nbsp; <br>
It is not nearly so widely recognized that Darwin failed <br>
to solve the problem indicated by the title of his work."<br>
<br>
Again, Mayr (1963, p.14): "In retrospect, it is <br>
apparent that Darwin's failure, as well as that of the <br>
antievolutionists, resulted to a large extent from a <br>
misunderstanding of the true nature of species."<br>
<br>
Mayr quotes the following section of the origin in <br>
support of these arguments (see p. 267 in his 1982 <br>
Growth of Biological Thought). However, Mayr puts <br>
a full stop directly after "distinguished from species", <br>
omitting the whole section starting with&nbsp; "... , - except <br>
....".&nbsp; In this way Mayr changes the whole sense of the <br>
(admittedly rather long) sentence.<br>
</i><br>
Finally, then, varieties have the same general characters as<br>
species, for they cannot be distinguished from species, --<br>
except, firstly, by the discovery of intermediate linking<br>
forms, and the occurrence of such links cannot affect the<br>
actual characters of the forms which they connect; and except,<br>
secondly, by a certain amount of difference, for two forms, if<br>
differing very little, are generally ranked as varieties,<br>
notwithstanding that intermediate linking forms have not been<br>
discovered; but the amount of difference considered necessary<br>
to give to two forms the rank of species is quite indefinite.<br>
<br>
p. 103 Ch. IV.&nbsp; Natural selection.&nbsp; In section "Circumstances<br>
favourable and unfavourable to natural selection, namely,<br>
intercrossing, isolation, number of individuals."<br>
Intercrossing plays a very important part in nature in keeping<br>
the individuals of the same species, or of the same variety,<br>
true and uniform in character.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>
<br>
<i>Editorial note: In this section, Darwin discusses various <br>
problems with assuming that geographic isolation was<br>
important in speciation. &nbsp;Evidently, this was a topic<br>
discussed in his day.</i><br>
<br>
p. 104-6<br>
Isolation, also, is an important element in the process of<br>
natural selection.&nbsp; In a confined or isolated area ... natural<br>
selection will tend to modify all the individuals of a varying<br>
species throughout the area in the same manner in relation to<br>
the same conditions.&nbsp; Intercrosses also, with the individuals<br>
of the same species, which otherwise would have inhabited the<br>
surrounding and differently circumstanced districts, will be<br>
prevented.&nbsp; But isolation probably acts more efficiently in<br>
checking the immigration of better adapted organisms, after<br>
any physical change, such as of climate or elevation of the<br>
land, &amp;c; and thus new places in the natural economy of the<br>
country are left open for the old inhabitants to struggle for,<br>
and become adapted to, through modification in their structure<br>
and constitution.&nbsp; Lastly, isolation, by checking immigration<br>
and consequently competition, will give time for any new<br>
variety to be slowly improved; and this may sometimes be of<br>
importance in the production of new species.&nbsp; If, however, an<br>
isolated area be very small, either from being surrounded by<br>
barriers, or from having very peculiar physical conditions,<br>
the total number of the individuals supported on it will<br>
necessarily be very small; and fewness of individuals will<br>
greatly retard the production of new species through natural<br>
selection, by decreasing the chance of the appearance of<br>
favourable mutations.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If we ... look at any small isolated area, such as an<br>
oceanic island, although the total number of the species<br>
inhabiting it, will be found to be small, as we shall see in<br>
our chapter on geographical distribution; yet of these species<br>
a very large proportion are endemic...&nbsp; Hence an oceanic<br>
island at first sight seems to have been highly favourable for<br>
the production of new species.&nbsp; But we may thus greatly<br>
deceive ourselves, for to ascertain whether a small isolated<br>
area, or a large open area like a continent, has been most<br>
favourable for the production of organic forms, we ought to<br>
make the comparison of equal times; and this we are incapable<br>
of doing.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Although I do not doubt that isolation is of considerable<br>
importance in the production of new species, on the whole I am<br>
inclined to believe that largeness of area is of more<br>
importance, more especially in the production of new species,<br>
which will prove capable of enduring for a long period, and of<br>
spreading widely.&nbsp; Throughout, a great and open area, not only<br>
will there be a better chance of favourable variations arising<br>
from the large number of individuals of the same species there<br>
supported, but the conditions of life are infinitely complex<br>
from the large number of already existing species; and if some<br>
of these many species become modified and improved, others<br>
will have to be improved in a corresponding degree or they<br>
will be exterminated. ...&nbsp; the course of modification will<br>
generally have been rapid on large areas; and what is more<br>
important, that the new forms produced on large areas, which<br>
already have been victorious over many competitors, will be<br>
those that will spread most widely, will give rise to most<br>
varieties and species, and will thus play an important part in<br>
the changing history of the organic world.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We can, perhaps, on these views, understand some facts<br>
which will be again alluded to in our chapter on geographical<br>
distribution; for instance, that the productions of the<br>
smaller continent of Australia have formerly yielded, and<br>
apparently now are yielding, before those of the larger<br>
Europaeo-Asiatic area.&nbsp; Thus, also, it is that continental<br>
productions have everywhere become so largely naturalized on<br>
islands. &nbsp;<br>
<br>
p. 107-8<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hence, perhaps, it comes that the flora of Madeira,<br>
according to Oswald Heer, resembles the extinct Tertiary flora<br>
of Europe.&nbsp; All fresh-water basins, taken together, make a<br>
small area compared with that of the sea or of the land; and,<br>
consequently, the competition between freshwater productions<br>
will have been less severe than elsewhere; new forms will have<br>
been slowly formed, and old forms more slowly exterminated.<br>
<br>
...&nbsp; I conclude, looking to the future, that for terrestrial<br>
productions a large continental area, which will probably<br>
undergo many oscillations of level, and which consequently<br>
will exist for long periods in a broken condition, will be the<br>
most favourable for the production of many new forms of life,<br>
likely to endure long and to spread widely.&nbsp; When converted by<br>
subsidence into large separate islands, there will still exist<br>
many individuals of the same species on each island:<br>
intercrossing on the confines of each species will thus be<br>
checked: after physical changes of any kind, immigration will<br>
be prevented, so that new species in the polity of each island<br>
will have to be filled up by modifications of the old<br>
inhabitants; and time will be allowed for the varieties in<br>
each to become well modified and perfected.&nbsp; When, by renewed <br>
elevation, the islands shall be re-converted into a<br>
continental area, there will again be severe competition: the<br>
most favoured or improved varieties will be enabled to spread:<br>
there will be much extinction of the less improved forms, and<br>
the relative proportional numbers of the various inhabitants<br>
of the renewed continent will again be changed; and there will<br>
be a fair field for natural selection to improve still further<br>
the inhabitants, and thus produce a new species.<br>
<br>
p. 171 Ch. VI.&nbsp; Difficulties on Theory.<br>
<br>
"Firstly, why, if species have descended from other species by<br>
insensibly fine gradations, do we not everywhere see<br>
innumerable transitional forms?&nbsp; Why is not all nature in<br>
confusion instead of species being, as we see them, well<br>
defined?<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Secondly (organs of trifling importance such as the<br>
giraffe's tail vs. organs of inimitable perfection, such as<br>
the eye)<br>
<br>
<br>
p. 172 <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thirdly, can instincts be acquired and modified by<br>
natural selection?<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Fourthly, how can we account for species, when crossed,<br>
being sterile and producing sterile offspring, whereas, when<br>
varieties are crossed, their fertility is unimpaired?<br>
<br>
p. 177<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To sum up, I believe that species come to be tolerably<br>
well-defined objects, and do not at any one period present an<br>
inextricable chaos of varying and intermediate links: firstly<br>
because new varieties are very slowly formed...<br>
p. 178<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Secondly, areas now continuous must often have existed<br>
within the recent period in isolated portions, in which many<br>
forms, more especially amongst the classes which unite for<br>
each birth and wander much, may have separately been rendered<br>
sufficiently distinct to rank as representative species. ...<br>
p. 178-9<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thirdly, when two or more varieties have been formed in<br>
different portions of a strictly continuous area, intermediate<br>
varieties will, it is probable, at first have been formed in<br>
the intermediate zones, but they will generally have had a<br>
short duration.&nbsp; (Because intermediate zones are smaller and<br>
will have lesser numbers of the species occupying them, and)<br>
From this cause alone, the intermediate varieties will be<br>
liable to accidental extermination; and during the process of<br>
further modification through natural selection, they will<br>
almost certainly be beaten and supplanted by the forms which<br>
they connect; for these from existing in greater numbers will,<br>
in the aggregate, present more variation, and thus be further<br>
improved through natural selection and gain further<br>
advantages.<br>
p.179<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lastly, looking not to any one time, but to all time, if<br>
my theory be true, numberless intermediate varieties, linking<br>
most closely all the species of the same group together, must<br>
assuredly have existed; but the very process of natural<br>
selection constantly tends .. to exterminate the parent-forms<br>
and the intermediate links.<br>
<br>
<i>Editorial note: the following chapter has been much<br>
misunderstood. &nbsp;I interpret it as a clear refutation of a<br>
simple "reproductive isolation" view or "biological <br>
concept" of species, and at the same time a strong<br>
argument for hybrid problems being a result of <br>
pleiotropic effects of natural selection, rather than<br>
being selected directly as "isolating mechanisms".<br>
The section refers to sterility, rather than <br>
inviability or any form of pre-mating isolation.<br>
</i>
<br>
p.246 in Ch VIII. Hybridism<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pure species have of course their organs of reproduction<br>
in a perfect condition, yet when intercrossed they produce<br>
either few or no offspring.&nbsp; Hybrids, on the other hand have<br>
their reproductive organs functionally impotent, ...<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The fertility of varieties, that is of the forms known or<br>
believed to have descended from common parents, when<br>
intercrossed, and likewise the fertility of their mongrel<br>
offspring, is, on my theory, of equal importance with the<br>
sterility of species; for it seems to make a broad and clear<br>
distinction between varieties and species.<br>
<br>
p. 246-7<br>
K&ouml;lreuter makes the rule (of sterility of species)<br>
universal; but then he cuts the knot, for in ten cases in<br>
which he found two forms, considered by most authors as<br>
distinct species, quite fertile together, he unhesitatingly<br>
ranks them as varieties.&nbsp; G&auml;rtner, also, makes the rule<br>
equally universal; and he disputes the entire fertility of<br>
K&ouml;lreuter's ten cases.<br>
p. 248<br>
... for all practical purposes it is most difficult to say<br>
where perfect fertility ends and sterility begins.&nbsp; I&nbsp; think<br>
no better evidence of this can be required than that the two<br>
most experienced observers who have ever lived, namely,<br>
K&ouml;lreuter and G&auml;rtner, should have arrived at<br>
diametrically opposite conclusions in regard to the very same<br>
species.<br>
p.257<br>
Now the fertility of first crosses between species, and of the<br>
hybrids produced from them, is largely governed by their<br>
systematic affinity.&nbsp; This is clearly shown by hybrids never<br>
having been raised between species ranked by systematists in<br>
distinct families; and on the other hand by very closely<br>
allied species generally uniting with facility.&nbsp; But the<br>
correspondence between systematic affinity and facility of<br>
crossing is by no means strict. ... (for example) In the same<br>
family there may be a genus, as Dianthus in which very many<br>
species can most readily be crossed; and another genus, as<br>
Silene, in which the most persevering efforts have failed to<br>
produce between extremely close species a single hybrid.<br>
p. 260-1<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now do these complex and singular rules indicate that<br>
species have been endowed with sterility simply to prevent<br>
their becoming confounded in nature?&nbsp; I think not.&nbsp; For why<br>
should sterility be so extremely different in degree, when<br>
various species are crossed, all of which we must suppose it<br>
would be equally important to keep from blending together? <br>
Why should the degree of sterility be innately variable in the<br>
individuals of the same species?&nbsp; Why should some species<br>
cross with facility, and yet produce very sterile hybrids; and<br>
other species cross with extreme difficulty, and yet produce<br>
fairly fertile hybrids?&nbsp; Why, it may even be asked, has the<br>
production of hybrids been permitted? to grant to species the<br>
special power of producing hybrids, and then to stop their<br>
further propagation by different degrees of sterility, not<br>
strictly related to the facility of the first union between<br>
their parents, seems to be a strange arrangement.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The foregoing rules and facts, on the other hand, appear<br>
to me clearly to indicate that the sterility, both of the<br>
first crosses and of hybrids is simply incidental or dependent<br>
on unknown differences, chiefly in the reproductive systems,<br>
of the species which are crossed.&nbsp; The differences being of so<br>
peculiar and limited a nature, that in reciprocal crosses<br>
between two species the male sexual element in one will often<br>
freely act on the female sexual element of the other, but not<br>
in reversed direction.<br>
<br>
p. 267-8<br>
Fertility of Varieties when crossed, and of their Mongrel<br>
offspring {, Not Universal - added to heading in 6th <br>
edition 1872}. -- It may be urged, as a most forceful argument,<br>
that there must be some essential distinction between species<br>
and varieties, and that there must be some error in all the<br>
foregoing remarks, inasmuch as varieties, however much they<br>
may differ from each other in external appearance, cross with<br>
perfect facility.&nbsp; I fully admit that this is almost<br>
invariably the case.&nbsp; But if we look to varieties produced<br>
under nature, we are immediately involved in hopeless<br>
difficulties; for if two hitherto reputed varieties be found<br>
in any degree sterile together, they are at once ranked by<br>
most naturalists as species.&nbsp; For instance the blue and red<br>
pimpernel, the primrose and the cowslip, which are considered<br>
by many of our best botanists as varieties, are said by<br>
G&auml;rtner not to be quite fertile when crossed, and he<br>
consequently ranks them as undoubted species.<br>
<br>
p. 269<br>
I have as yet spoken as if the varieties of the same species<br>
were invariably fertile when intercrossed. But it seems to me <br>
impossible to resist the evidence of a certain amount of sterility <br>
in the few following cases, which I will briefly abstract.&nbsp; The <br>
evidence is at least as good as that from which we believe in the <br>
sterility of a multitude of species.&nbsp; The evidence is, also, derived <br>
from hostile witnesses, who in all other cases consider fertility <br>
and sterility as safe criterions of specific distinction. &nbsp;<br>

<br>
p. 271-2: From these facts; from the great difficulty of <br>
ascertaining the infertility of varieties in a state of nature, for <br>
a supposed variety if infertile in any degree would generally <br>
be ranked as species; from man selecting only external <br>
characters in the production of the most distinct domestic <br>
varieties, and from not wishing or being able to produce <br>
recondite and functional differences in the reproductive <br>
system; from these several considerations and facts, I do<br>
not think that the very general fertility of varieties can be <br>
proved to be of universal occurrence, or to form a <br>
fundamental distinction between varieties and species.&nbsp; The <br>
general fertility of varieties does not seem to me sufficient to <br>
overthrow the view which I have taken with respect to the <br>
very general, but not invariable, sterility of first crosses and <br>
of hybrids, namely, that it is not a special endowment, but is <br>
incidental on slowly acquired modifications, more especially <br>
in the reproductive systems of the forms which are crossed.<br>

enabled to connect them together by close intermediate<br>
gradations.<br>
<br>
p. 484-5. Ch. XIV Recapitulation and conclusion.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When the views entertained in this volume on the origin<br>
of species, or when analogous views are generally admitted, we<br>
can dimly foresee that there will be a considerable revolution<br>
in natural history.&nbsp; Systematists will be able to pursue their<br>
labours as at present; but they will not be incessantly<br>
haunted by the shadowy doubt whether this or that form be in<br>
essence a species. .. The endless disputes whether or not some<br>
fifty species of British brambles are true species will cease. <br>
Systematists will have only to decide (not that this will be<br>
easy) whether any form be sufficiently constant and distinct<br>
from other forms, to be capable of definition; and if<br>
definable, whether the differences be sufficiently important<br>
to deserve a specific name. ... Hereafter, we shall be<br>
compelled to acknowledge that the only distinction between<br>
species and well-marked varieties is, that the latter are<br>
known, or believed, to be connected at the present day by<br>
intermediate gradations, whereas species were formerly thus<br>
connected.&nbsp; Hence, without quite rejecting the consideration<br>
of the present existence of intermediate gradations between<br>
two forms, we shall be led to weigh more carefully and to<br>
value higher the actual amount of difference between them.&nbsp; It<br>
is quite possible that forms now generally acknowledged to be<br>
merely varieties may hereafter be thought worthy of specific<br>
names, as with the primrose and the cowslip; and in this case<br>
scientific and common language will come into accordance.&nbsp; In<br>
short, we shall have to treat species in the same manner as<br>
those naturalists treat genera, who admit that genera are<br>
merely artificial combinations made for convenience.&nbsp; This may<br>
not be a cheering prospect; but we shall at least be freed<br>
from the vain search for the undiscovered and undiscoverable<br>
essence of the term species.<br>
