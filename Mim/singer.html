      <td valign="top"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Prof. Michael
        C. Singer (MA Oxon, First Class Honours) is an excellent although unusual
        example of brain-drain from the UK. Before he moved to Plymouth, UK, Singer managed his  teaching and butterfly
        evolution empire from its <a href="singer_office.html">nerve centre in
        the Patterson Building &quot;Department of Integrative Biology&quot; at
        UT</a>.</font>
        <p></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">His <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Michael_Singer9">home page</a> and <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=4re_Gg8AAAAJ&hl=en">Google Scholar</a> pages seem not to express his true essence (although
          they give his impressive publications), so I felt that these pictures
          in  &quot;<a href="../portraits.html">Portraits and Quotations</a>&quot;
          could rectify the problem. Test your knowledge of scientific
         temrinology -- Singer's first year UT Biology (Austin, Texas) students
         used to have to answer these: see <a href="gladys_bernie.html">Gladys &amp;
          Bernie's discussions</a>. Prospective (post)graduate students, see <a href="singer_grad_advice.htm">Singer's
          advice on choosing a university and PhD supervisor</a>.</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Singer has had
          a massive influence on generations of undergraduate and graduate students
          at UT and researchers on butterfly ecology and behaviour elsewhere,
          including myself. He probably doesn't realize how important this has
          been for those of us who have benefited.</font></p>
