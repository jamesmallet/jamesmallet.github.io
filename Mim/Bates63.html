      </p>





      <p>"None of the Arrassar&iacute;s, to my knowledge, make a yelping

noise like that uttered by the larger Toucans (Ramphastos); the

notes of the curl-crested species are very singular, resembling the croaking

of frogs. I had an amusing adventure one day with these birds. I had shot

one from a rather high tree in a dark glen in the forest, and leaving my

gun leaning against a tree-trunk in the pathway, went into the thicket

where the bird had fallen, to secure my booty. It was only wounded, and

on my attempting to seize it, it set up a loud scream. In an instant, as

if by magic, the shady nook seemed alive with these birds, although there

was certainly none visible when I entered the thicket. They descended towards

me, hopping from bough to bough, some of them swinging in the loops and

cables of woody lianas, and all croaking and fluttering their wings like

so many furies. Had I had a long stick in my hand I could have knocked

several of them over. After killing the wounded one I rushed out to fetch

my gun, but, the screaming of their companion having ceased, they remounted

the trees, and before I could reload, every one of them had disappeared."</p>









      <p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><b>Note:</b> a version of this

engraving (left) in Bates' book was republished by Amabel Williams-Ellis (1966:

"Darwin&#8217;s Moon: A Biography of Alfred Russel Wallace". Blackie, London

&amp; Glasgow), with the protagonist's features accentuated to make him

look like Alfred Russel Wallace, but it is clear from the text above that

it was Bates who had the experience.&nbsp; The only inconsistency is that

artist has depicted a gun in Bates' hand which he did not have when the

toucans were croaking at him from close range.&nbsp; Williams-Ellis' altered

picture was again republished erroneously as a picture of Wallace by Helena

Cronin (1991: "The Ant and the Peacock." Cambridge Univ. Press, Cambridge).<br>

      <p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Bates was <a href="leicester/leicesterbateswallace.html">born in Leicester</a>.&nbsp;

He went to the Amazon after meeting <a href="Wallace.html">Alfred Russel Wallace</a> by accident

in the Leicester Public Library, while Wallace was teaching in the <a href="leicester/collegiate_sch4.html">Collegiate School</a>.&nbsp;

In 1847, they decided together that an empirical approach, a collecting

trip "towards solving the problem of origin of species" would reap

scientific dividends.<br>
