<p>Moritz [or Moriz] W. Wagner was a well-known German geographer and naturalist 
  who travelled widely. He is known among geographers and historians for publications 
  of his travels in North, Central and South America and the Caribbean, as well 
  as North Africa, Persia, Armenia, Georgia and Iraq. See also: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moritz_Wagner">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moritz_Wagner</a></p>
<p>From an evolutionary biologist's point of view, Wagner is most famous for having 
  developed a theory he variously called &quot;Migrationstheorie,&quot; &quot;Law 
  of Migration,&quot; or &quot;Separationstheorie.&quot; He corresponded with 
  Darwin, who received his ideas cooly. In 1868, he argued that Darwin's ideas 
  of speciation were incomplete, and proposed what he felt was an important addition: 
  that small colonies, containing a subset of the existing variation, migrated 
  to a new region, whereupon the changed conditions would cause Lamarckian evolution 
  of new species. He felt that &quot;Absonderung&quot; (or dispersal, followed 
  by geographic isolation) was essential for the formation of new species by preventing 
  intercrossing. </p>
<p>Wagner's model was acknowledged as a forerunner by Ernst Mayr to his own &quot;founder 
  effect&quot; model of allopatric speciation (1954). Careful reading indicates 
  that Wagner (1868) felt that Darwin hadn't explained <em>the source of initial 
  divergence</em>, or <em>the source of variation</em>, that led to speciation. 
  Lamarckian evolution of traits caused by novel conditions in a new location 
  after migration was Wagner's answer to the problem. Geographic isolation aided 
  this process by preventing intercrossing, so allowing the Lamarckian evolution 
  to continue without being swamped by the parent form.</p>
<p>Wagner's ideas were strongly resisted by Darwinists, particularly August Weismann, 
  Ernst Haeckel, Alfred Russel Wallace, John Thomas Gulick, as well as by Darwin 
  himself. It seems likely that Darwin found these views annoying because many 
  of Wagner's published ideas on geographic isolation could also be found in his 
  own <em>Origin of Species</em>, but were insufficiently acknowledged by Wagner, 
  and that most of his novel ideas were poorly supported or demonstrably wrong. 
  Darwin scribbled &quot;most wretched rubbish&quot; across one of Wagner's papers 
  (1875, published in <em>Ausland</em> -- see Sulloway 1979 for this story). Wagner 
  felt that his idea was a major advance: &quot;Those who with Darwin deny the 
  necessity of isolation for natural selection, and only admit its advantage, 
  must indicate another cause for the first stimulus to increased variation, and 
  other conditions upon which the preservation of the new characteristics depend.&quot; 
  (from the 1873 translation of Wagner 1868).</p>
<p>In later years, particularly 1880, Wagner hardened his stance against Darwinism, 
  arguing that his own Migrationstheorie was not only an essential improvement 
  ofDarwin's theory of evolution as he had stated in 1868, but also incompatible 
  with Darwin's theory of natural selection (he effusively thanked Weismann for 
  clearing this matter up). Having been criticised on the basis that mimicry could 
  not be explained by Separationstheorie, Wagner argued that actually mimicry 
  was explained better by Separationstheorie than by natural selection. In his 
  view, variants within populations, finding they had the wrong colours to adapt 
  to local situations, were impelled innately to move to areas, substrates, and 
  habitats where their colours hid them from their natural enemies (including 
  living among others having the same colours, as in Muellerian mimicry). Having 
  got there, the new varieties would also be protected from intercrossing with 
  the ancestral species by geographic distance, and would form a new species. 
  Thus it was movement of the pre-adapted forms to better habitats, not selection 
  of varieties in the new habitats, that permitted evolutionary progress.</p>
<p>He doesn't seem to have noticed the profound changes in his own theory, which 
  initially required a change of conditions to induce the variation in the geographically 
  isolated population. In 1880, he instead argued that the variants already in 
  the parental population, having migrated, required an absence of intercrossing 
  due to isolation from the parental population. This allowed the novel variation 
  to become fixed, and species to form. </p>
<p>He equated the movement of twig-like caterpillars by night towards leaves, 
  and the movement back down towards the bark, in terms of Separationstheorie. 
  The reason why caterpillars are twig mimics, apparently, is that variants which 
  happened to be camouflaged on twigs choose suitable twigs on which to rest. 
  This is supposedly a more parsimonous explanation than the Darwinians', which 
  requires caterpillars resting on twigs to be selected against if they do not 
  resemble twigs. Needless to say, Separationstheorie could explain everything. 
</p>
<p><a href="http://www.ucl.ac.uk/taxome/jim/Mim/Mayr.html">Ernst Mayr</a> frequently 
  alluded to Wagner's theories as important forerunners of his own views on geographic 
  isolation. However, Mayr ignored the abundant criticism of Wagner from that 
  time, as well as Wagner's odd views and extreme anti-selection stance. There 
  is a good discussion of this aspect of Mayr's thinking, as well as of Wagner's 
  theories, by Sulloway (1979). </p>
<p>In a review of Wagner's 1889 post mortem book, Charles S. Minot (1890) writes: 
</p>
</font> 
<blockquote>
  <p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">&quot;Wagner's essays show the journalist's 
    [talents]. They are all discursive and pleasant, it is easy to read along 
    in them, but there is a complete absence of that formidable marshalling of, 
    facts and unconquerable logic which is the stamp of Darwin's work. Wagner 
    nowhere compiles all the facts of geographical isolation, nor enumerates those 
    which conflict with his theory, either to acknowledge their force or explain 
    them away.&quot;</font></p>

<p>It is of historical interest to note that Wagner's ideas, which blended evolutionary 
  ideas with social science and geography, had some far reaching effects. An important 
  disciple, Friedrich Ratzel, who was influenced by Wagner in Munich, developed 
  the social Darwinist theory that 'fitter' nations (such as Germany) would expand 
  their borders at the expense of less successful nations. He coined the term 
  'Lebensraum' and his work led to the invention of the idea of 'Geopolitik.' 
  Ideas such as these were to culminate in certain expansionist ideas that led 
  to much suffering during the 20th Century. See: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friedrich_Ratzel">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friedrich_Ratzel</a>. 
  Ratzel also wrote an important biography of Wagner (Ratzel 1896).</p>
