<p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif">In Britain the importance of Darwin 
  and his theory of evolution by natural selection is recognized at the highest 
  levels of politics and government. Above, you should be able to see a link to 
  the Bank of England's image of the E-series &pound;10 note, dated 2000.</font> 
</p>
<p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif">If Darwin had been American, would 
  we would have seen his portrait on a dollar denomination bill next to the inscription 
  "In God We Trust"?</font> </p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif">I personally knew what journalists would call "a source close to the Governer of the Bank of England" about the Darwin &pound;10 note, and he told me that the Bank had been a little worried about possible negative public reaction to the release of the note. However, the Bank was relieved when the potentially controversial banknote was received with no negative publicity whatsoever.</font> </p>
<p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif"><i>"</i></font><i>Darwin's book was 
  misnamed, because it is ... not a treatise on the origin of species</i> <font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif"><i>"</i>. 
  &nbsp;True or false? &nbsp;Judge for yourself; read what <a href="darwin_on_spp.html">Darwin 
  actually said on species and speciation</a>. </font></p>
<p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif">Unfortunately, today "<a href="https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/news/2018/february/the-darwin-10-is-almost-extinct-just-one-week-to-go">The Darwin &pound;10 is almost extinct</a>." Actually (6 Feb 2019), the Darwin &pound;10 note is now completely extinct since 1 Mar 2018. I have enormous respect for Jane Austen, but I'm an evolutionary biologist; you might want to hoard your Darwin notes, because they are no longer printed, having been replaced with hi-tech Jane Austen notes with transparent windows. The Darwin &pound;10 note was legal tender till 23:59 on 1 Mar 2018. After that you have to hope you can exchange them with a bank.</font></p>
