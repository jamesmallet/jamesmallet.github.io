<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font color="#006600">Framework 6</font></font></b>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The EU Framework 6 Programme is not yet
fully ratified, but some details have been published. New proposals are
for Integrated Projects, Networks of Excellence, as well as other more
typical Framework 5-type multinational research funding.</font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Like Framework 5, Framework 6 will allow
proposals according to certain thematic needs envisioned to integrate EU
research. For our purposes, the relevant thematic/research areas<font color="#000000">
would probably come under:</font></font>
<blockquote><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font color="#000000">1.1 Genomics
and biotechnology for health</font></font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font color="#000000">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
1.1.1.1 Comparative genomics and population genetics</font></font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font color="#000000">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
1.1.1.1 Bioinformatics</font></font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font color="#000000">1.6 Sustainable
development, global change and ecosystems</font></font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font color="#000000">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
1.6.3 Biodiversity and ecosystems</font></font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font color="#000000">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
1.6.3 Operational forecasting and modelling, including global climate change
observation systems</font></font></blockquote>
<font face="Arial,Helvetica">As well as the establishment of new Integrated
Projects (which have larger funding bases than most typical FP5-type projects,
would be for 5 years and 3 countries at least, and may have budgets of
10 million Euros, say), accounting rules have been simplified, to make
them more flexible and responsive. In addition, there is the establishment
of "Expression of Interest" documents (short, 5 pages?? -- document received
by our EU office today, and not yet distributed to us), which would give
some feedback as to the Commission's interest in funding Integrated Projects
and Networks of Excellence.</font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">DEADLINE: the deadline for Expressions
of Interest was announced on 20 March 2002 to be June 7 2002. We therefore
need to act <i>now</i>, if we are to get a sensible Expression of Interest
in!</font>
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font color="#006600">Background</font></font></b>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Taxonomy is a basic need for all branches
of biological science and biotechnology. In particular it is vital that
taxonomy infrastructure is in place in order to carry out our commitments
with respect to Convention on Biological Diversity agreements signed by
EU governments. The existence of expert taxonomists, taxonomic databases,
and databases of geographic distribution data are also being used effectively
to understand and monitor and biological effects of global climate change.
The taxonomic data and knowledge of will be essential for predicting future
effects of climate change.</font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Yet funding for taxonomy normally falls
by the wayside. In Britain, a House of Lords Report in 1992 led to some
releases of new funds for systematics, but most of this money seems to
have been diverted via NERC towards "The New Taxonomy", essentially population
genetics and the development of novel molecular markers then coming on
stream in the NERC remit area.</font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Little money, if any (?) was added to alpha-taxonomy,
and today NERC, pressed for funds, has expressed intent to remove its commitment
to basic taxonomy. My belief is that similar problems are endemic in most
EU countries. For example in France in particular.</font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Meanwhile, over the last ten years the
USA has increased funding for systematics, and also basic taxonomy, with
NSF competitive funding ring-fenced for taxonomy, systematics and phylogeny,
and also floristic and faunistic inventory work. Europe badly needs to
catch up.</font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The majority of the world's expertise in
taxonomy probably still resides in major European Museums, in particular
in London, Paris, and Berlin (and a number of other German institutions).
These key European collections themselves remain of inestimable value as
taxonomic databases to Europe and also for the rest of the world. However,
the funding problems for taxonomy means that taxonomic expertise is almost
never being replaced by new training or new posts. Instead, Museums such
as the Natural History Museum are developing expertise in the "New Taxonomy"
areas, ecology, evolutionary biology, molecular systematics.</font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">At the same time, DNA sequencing and the
ability to obtain molecular phylogenies has become much easier, and very
large throughput robotic sequencing, and new techniques for data analysis
means that very large projects in DNA-based phylogeny estimation have never
been easier.</font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">DNA-based "natural history" (e.g. population
structure, studies of gene flow and hybridisation, biogeography, molecular
ecology) is an ideal partner for traditional taxonomy, and is engaged in
increasingly mutualistic interactions with museum taxonomy. But the requirement
of an infrastructure of morphological taxonomy remains essential for the
furtherance of this work.</font>
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font color="#006600">A very rough proposal
outline</font></font></b>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">I propose that what is needed is to jump
start a new and exciting era in taxonomy by blending modern techniques
with traditional taxonomic expertise and collections data. An EU Integrated
Project could provide a flagship for what can be done in taxonomy and fundamental
biological informatics infrastructure.</font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">I would argue that we need to establish
taxonomy/molecular phylogeny centres in the three core countries containing
most of the worlds' museum collections: France, Germany and UK. Other countries
such as Spain, Italy, Finland and Sweden should undoubtedly be involved.</font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">We cannot establish taxonomy on all organisms
simultaneously. I propose that we concentrate on butterflies because<font color="#000000">
(1)</font><font color="#FF0000"> </font>They are already among the best-understood
organisms taxonomically, so we start from a firm basis on which to do a
complete inventory of the worlds' species; (2) We can identify key taxonomists
worldwide who would provide coverage for the entire diversity of the worlds'
?20,000 species. (3) The numbers of species within the monophyletic group
are manageable for obtaining DNA information. (4) They are already important
indicator organisms for many ecological, biodiversity and conservation
projects - for instance, the British Charity Butterfly Conservation is
the second largest only to birds (RSPB) in terms of membership in the UK.
(5) Detailed distribution knowledge has been very important in documenting
the effect of Global Warming over the last 10 years. (6) Many groups worldwide
are already generating DNA data necessary to understand the complete phylogeny
of butterflies; here again, an outline of which are useful DNA sequences
required for doing the complete phylogeny work has already been established.</font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">I would argue we need for at least half
of all funds to go towards major systematic institutions in European countries.
The other half, for molecular work (purchase of robotic sequencing and
PCR equipment, as well as research salary costs, for instance) and phylogeny
estimation, would be easier to find partners for, because many research
groups in universities are now working on molecular phylogeny-related questions.</font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Particularly for the taxonomy we will need
help and support from outside the EU. These would come in the form of key
international figures like Gerardo Lamas (Lima) and Bob Robbins (Smithsonian).
Together with other Europeans and non-European taxonomists, these scientists
founded GloBIS, an ambitious program to generate a defnitive taxonomy of
butterflies worldwide. In other words, the GloBIS program is what the Butterfly
Taxome Project hopes to fund.&nbsp; Geneticists like Dave Heckel (<a href="http://www.genetics.unimelb.edu.au/Person/DH.html">Melbourne</a>)
&amp; and Jerry Regier (<a href="http://www.umbi.umd.edu/~cab/Regier.html">Maryland</a>)
are very important in the Lepidoptera genetics field, and would be interested
in such a project. Non-Europeans working outside the EU cannot obtain salary
money from the EU, but they could have support in the form of travel visits,
and their students or postdocs can be employed in EU countries under the
remit of this Integrated Project.</font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">We need to present the results of this
work using modern means of delivery of taxonomic and genomic data. I would
envisage linking with web-based taxonomy and butterfly genomic organizations
such as ALL-Species (USA), Tree of Life (USA), Species 2000 (UK), GloBIS
(International) as well as via the usual genome databases, but also the
International Lepidoptera Genome Project based in Italy.</font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">After our successful project has been carried
out, the butterflies will provide an example for what is needed for completion
of the taxonomy and phylogeny of all species. Others will learn from our
methods, as well as perhaps from the few mistakes we might make from time
to time!</font>
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font color="#006600">Parochial Concerns:
Jim Mallet at UCL; why me?</font></font></b>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">NERC has been funding my own proposals
"with less vigour" as they get more taxonomic. Yet NERC or charities like
the Leverhulme Trust are the only means of funding what I regard as important:
the biodiversity/taxonomy/ genetics/evolution interface.</font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">I am now an honorary researcher at the
Natural History Museum, and am planning closer integration in future.</font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">A major move by several UCL Biology research
groups out of Wolfson House to a refurbished couple of floors in the Darwin
Building in Gower Street has led to the unusual situation (in London) of
some office and lab space opening up in this building. However, the space
is not popular with other members of UCL, who don't like to cross Euston
Road. Therefore, for the near future, we have the room to expand; a nerve
centre for a major project at Wolfson House would be popular with the UCL
hierarchy, and good use of the space.</font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">I have no less than 4 EU Marie Curie Fellows
working with me or shortly coming here, doing work broadly related to the
proposed Integrated Project. So EU clearly does fund my kind of research.</font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">UCL is well-connected with the EU funding
mechanisms, and is in the top 3 institutions in this country for successful
funding by FP5.&nbsp;&nbsp; The Natural History Museum, London, has close
links with many associated projects on European taxonomy, and also has
an excellent track record for EU funding.</font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The EU would fund proper office management
for such an enormous project. This would make it doable, as far as I am
concerned.</font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Wolfson House has a new Department of Mathematics/Biology/Biochemistry
institute called COMPLEX, which has just moved into the building. Data
analysis and the bioinformatics of such large volumes of both traditional
taxonomic and also sequence data, and its analysis, would fit in well with
their program of PhD projects and mathematics/biology theory interface.</font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">I sincerely believe that coordinating this
programme would be good use of my time and would provide genuine benefits
to EU and indeed world science.</font>
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font color="#006600">Immediate Needs</font></font></b>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">I am sending this to you because if I am
to organise an Expression of Interest, I must have some immediate feedback
from all of you. Here are my specific questions:</font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">All: Are you interested in participating,
or seeing this idea enacted? Send me any views, however hastily put together.
The important thing to me now is a response from you! Any thoughts, ideas,
or even insults would be welcome.</font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">EU Office at UCL and NHM Finance People:
Would this brief outline seem a possible Integrated Project? I don't think
it would be worth it for me to put in for a smaller project, because of
the (time commitment/return in terms of research output) ratio. The Integrated
Project for such fundamental infrastructure research would seem to me to
be the correct method of funding such a project.</font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Butterfly people: I need to rapidly accumulate
contacts in Europe, particularly Paris and Berlin. This cannot wait till
the Butterfly meeting in Leiden in late March, unfortunately, because of
the 20<sup>th</sup> March deadline. PLEASE SEND ME NAMES and any details
of institutions that should be incorporated URGENTLY!</font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Should we include skippers? Or would their
taxonomic coverage be too sparse?</font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">I am pretty good on the secondary countries
I mentioned above, and also on molecular phylogeny practitioners in Europe.
But send me these ideas anyway! I am less good on taxonomists in major
European Institions.</font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">We need to include as many key people (by
which I mean people who would actually bring the project forward, as opposed
to just people who work in the general area and are in a country which
we feel we ought to include). In particular, I think this will be hardest
for taxonomists.</font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Dave Heckel: Please send me information
on the Lepidoptera Mapping Scheme in Italy you told me about!</font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">All the best to you all,</font>
