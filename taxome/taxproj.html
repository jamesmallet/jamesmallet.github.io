<b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font color="#006600"><font size="+2"><br>
Outline</font></font></font></b>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The Lepidoptera Taxome Project aims to
coordinate
the production, completion, and dissemination of online taxonomy of
Lepidoptera
on our planet at the species and subspecies level.&nbsp; There are
about
<a href="lepnos.html">180,000 described species</a> of Lepidoptera,
around
10% of all described species of living organisms.</font> </p>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">This project started out life as the
Butterfly
Taxome Project. Given the data banks already available for moths and
the
enthusiasm of people such as Malcolm Scoble, Niels Kristensen, and
George
Beccaloni, it seems that at the very least a synonymic catalogue for
the
entire Lepidoptera will be possible within five years, and should be
undertaken.
Malcolm Scoble's group has already completed a baseline project on the
Geometridae
(21,000 species) which demonstrates that the project is plausible. In
the
butterflies (Papilionoidea), there are about <a href="rhopnos.html">17,500
described species</a>, or 1% of known organisms, and they will be
covered
in much greater detail than the moths, including original descriptions
and
photographs of type specimens or illustrations for almost every name.</font>
</p>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">In addition, we will obtain DNA
sequences
from various suitable mitochondrial and nuclear genes useful at least
for
every butterfly genus or group of genera.&nbsp; The project will
therefore
enable a preliminary phylogenetic analysis based on these genes as well
as
pre-existing morphological data, for use in classification.</font> </p>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">This project is intended as a catalyst
for
a complete taxome project of all of life.&nbsp; The butterflies and
moths
represent a benchmark project for the inventory of life, in the same
way
that <i>Drosophila</i> or human genomes are benchmarks for the genomes
of
all other species.&nbsp; Unlike some other databasing approaches, this
project
will be completely taxon-oriented, on the grounds that a complete
taxonomy
of 10% of the fauna is more useful than a partial taxonomy of a larger
phylogenetic
grouping.</font> </p>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The project will attempt to concentrate
on
the taxonomy of the organisms, rather than getting too sidetracked into
the
databasing requirements for that taxonomy.&nbsp; Thus we aim to foster
existing
expertise and hire new blood into taxonomy and related disciplines, as
well
as do a lot of typing.</font> </p>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Butterflies in particular are
well-recognized
in conservation and biodiversity fields, and changes in the geographic
distributions
of butterflies have been particularly effective in demonstrating the
biological
effects of global climate change.&nbsp; Lepidoptera in general are
among
the major crop pests. Thus, the Lepidoptera Taxome Project will provide
immediate
direct benefits for management of natural and agricultural ecosystems,
in
addition to its role as an exemplar for future projects.</font> </p>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">There are many databasing and taxonomic
projects
for other groups of organisms, but few come near to moths and
butterflies
in terms of potential overall coverage, molecular phylogeny data,
economic
and iconic importance, knowledge of biology, ecology and distribution
data.&nbsp;
The project will aim to collect together existing data under a single
umbrella
organization consisting of virtually all butterfly taxonomists
worldwide,
as well as to highlight and target weak taxonomic or molecular genetic
coverage
in certain phylogenetic groups.</font> </p>
<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font color="#006600"><font size="+2">Achieving
our goals</font></font></font></b> </p>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">We propose funding basic,
alpha-taxonomy
and molecular phylogenetic work in approximately equal proportion to
complete
this project. EU funding is currently being investigated; other funding
is
of course not ruled out.</font> </p>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font color="#000000">These documents
were
prepared after a strategy meeting in Leiden between Andy Brower, Rienk
de
Jong, Jim Mallet, Soren Nylin, Carla Penz, Felix Sperling, Dick Vane
Wright,
Niklas Wahlberg and Keith Willmott, with the help of some significant
comments
from others, such as Naomi Pierce, Alan Heath and Carol
Boggs.&nbsp;&nbsp;
Subsequently, many others have had input into the submission of the
final
documents listed above.</font></font> </p>
<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font color="#006600"><font size="+2">Expression
of interest</font></font></font></b> </p>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">A draft "<a href="eoi.pdf">expression
of
interest</a>" for an EU Framework 6 Integrated Project was circulated
to
members of the Lepidoptera Taxome Project on 23 May 2002.&nbsp; After
consultation,
it was decided to broaden the remit.&nbsp; ENHSIN (European Natural
History
Specimen Information Network), and ENBI (European Network for
Biodiversity
Information) were two groups through CETAF (Consortium of European
Taxonomic
Facilities) all supported the idea, and recommended our project as one
of
the projects they would promote.&nbsp; In the end, this resulted an
approach
to the group associated with Species2000 based in Reading, who agreed
to
let us join their <a href="evbleoi.pdf">expression of interest</a>
entitled&nbsp;
the "European Virtual Biodiversity Laboratory".&nbsp; I visited Frank
Bisby
in Reading a week before the deadline for EOIs, to discuss the
situation.
While the EVBL may be the best partner for the Lepidoptera Taxome
Project,
our project was a very small part of a very expansive group.&nbsp; In
the end (2004) Frank Bisby decided not to use our services.</font> </p>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">It was therefore felt that an
Integrated
Project more focused on taxonomy and its relation to the rest of
biological
science, using Lepidoptera as the model taxome, would still be worth
submitting
separately.&nbsp; The result was the final collaborative EOI: "<a
 href="eoi2.pdf">Taxonomy serving society</a>",
which included the taxonomic
component, and delivered its benefits to society via a number of
possible
intermediary groups including collections databasers, geneticists,
agricultural
biologists, ecologists, ecological modellers and
conservationists.&nbsp; These EOIs and proposals didn't come to much,
and I have to say that the funding situation at the European level for
taxonomy is dire; the argument I suppose is that taxonomy isn't
important enough financially, or in terms of climate change, to justify
any expenditure.&nbsp; <br>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">I still have some hope that the
political situation for such fundamental documentation and science will
change, and the vast archival resources and taxonomic expertise of
Europe can be brought to bear on the problem of the lack of freely
available taxonomic information.&nbsp; We just need to make a more
convincing case.<br>
</font></p>
<p><font color="#006600" size="+2"><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">GBIF-ECAT
Grant</font></b></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">In 2003 and 2004, <a
 href="http://www.gbif.org/">GBIF</a>
issued calls for proposals for "Electronic Catalogue of Life (ECAT)"
and
"Digitization of Collections (DIGIT)". Members of our group put in
ECAT proposals for a butterfly project <a
 href="GBIF_Butterfly_Names_pre.pdf">Global Butterfly Names</a> and a
separate project to document the "macromoths". &nbsp;Together, these
projects aim to use <i><a
 href="http://www.nhm.ac.uk/entomology/lepindex/">LepIndex</a></i>
and a variety of other information sources to document around 200,000
of the approximately 291,000 Lepidoptera
scientific names, their current status and taxonomic rank.&nbsp; <br>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">We have now received limited funding for</font><font
 face="Arial,Helvetica"> <a href="GBIF_Butterfly_Names_pre.pdf">Global
Butterfly Names</a>,
and are starting work on this grant, which will run October 2004-March
2006.&nbsp; The major funding will go towards short-term</font><font
 face="Arial,Helvetica"> hiring</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica">
(5 months, depending on the value of the US$) of an internationally
respected researcher, Dr. Gerardo Lamas, to provide work towards a
global butterfly names database.&nbsp; We are in the process of
contacting major world butterfly taxonomy researchers across the globe,
and would appreciate any help with useful contacts, particularly within
mainland China and other Asian countries.</font><font

<p><font color="#006600" size="+2"><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The
future<br>
</font></b></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The successful GBIF grant application
is at least encouraging, if modest, progress towards the Taxome
Project.&nbsp; However, we still have a long way to go to convince
governments and NGOs that the overall project is valuable and of
national and international importance, especially as a useful trial run
for the overall Catalogue of Life and online taxonomy proposals put
forward by the likes of EO Wilson and HCJ Godfray.&nbsp; All ideas and
suggestions as how to proceed further are welcome! </font>
