<font face="Arial,Helvetica">Ashburner,M
(2002): Comment on Godfray's article (of January 2002). Antenna 26, 73-74.</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">(Prof. Ashburner is involved with <a href="http://flybase.bio.indiana.edu/">FlyBase</a>,
the Drosophila information database).</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">p. 73: There is one major distinction between
the databases that serve the bioinformatics community and molecular biologists
[<i>sic</i>; actually, we ought to consider taxonomy as maybe the type
specimen of bioinformatics!] and those that serve taxonomists, at least
with respect to the taxonomic databases I have visited.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The major databases of nucleic acid sequence,
protein sequence, and protein structure are truly open sources.&nbsp; The
international nucleic acid sequence data library, for example, is available
to anyone to download onto their own machine without conditions, let or
hindrance....</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The advantage of this open policy is inestimable.
... No database can claim to be "in the public domain" unless its entire
contents are available as ASCII text or database table dumps (from an FTP
site).&nbsp; There are many ways of making data truly available to the
public without losing control over it (see, for example ftp://ftp.ebi.ac.uk/pub/databases/variantdbs/hgbase/LICENSE).</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Were the taxonomic community to embrace
this concept, then the absolute chaos, that, to an outsider, now seems
to exist in that field, might be improved.</font>
