Taxome Project -- James Mallet

The "Taxome Project" was a project I created to document the named diversity of life. I started with Lepidoptera, and in particular butterflies. It seemed to me that it might be possible to create a butterfly checklist of the world, and make it freely available online. I am an evolutionary geneticist, not a taxonomist, but I am a naturalist at heart, and so I am a major user of taxonomy in my studies of South American Heliconius and ithomiine butterflies. And I was close to taxonomists with big ideas.

For instance, Sandra Knapp in the Natural History Museum, London, has done major work documenting the systematics and in particular an illustrated list of the Solanaceae of the world (https://solanaceaesource.myspecies.info/). Sandra Knapp was also a major player in the Melbourne meeting of 2011, which led to major modernization of the "botanical code," or as it is now called, "The International Code of Nomenclature for algae, fungi, and plants." She has also contributed to recent updates in Madrid.

Another systematist, Gerardo Lamas, at the Museo de Historia Natural, Universidad Mayor de San Marcos, Lima, had documented a complete list of Neotropical Butterflies. We found similar complete butterfly species name lists, complete with subspecies names, for Australia (Michael Braby) and Africa (Mark C. Williams), and North America (Pelham). Eurasia was never completed, except for certain families of butterflies (by Gerardo Lamas).

My vision of the Taxome Project was to create a buzz that could attract funding. Taxonomist friends told me that nobody wanted to fund taxonomy, and that my project wouldn't work. We did obtain a small grant from GBIF, and because of Keith Willmott's application (with myself as PI), another multi-year grant from the UK Darwin Initiative to study Tropical Andean Butterfly Diversity (TABD) (https://www.darwininitiative.org.uk/project/DAR14047/).

As well as the most complete available list of butterfly names for the Neotropics, Gerardo had also traveled worldwide, visited many museums, and photographed many of the type specimens (which are important for standardizing species and subspecies names) and stored in taxonomic order in a card inex as 4" x 6" prints. In the final throes of TABD, we bought high throughput scanning equipment for the Lima Natural History Museum. Carlos Peña helped link the names to the photos. Later, TABD allowed Nick Grishin to use the data to make public the species or subspecies names linked to all the type specimens Lamas photographed. Through Nick's web wizardry, the results are available, although also supplemented by others' contributions, at the Butterflies of America -- All America Page: https://butterfliesofamerica.com/L/Neotropical.htm

But in the end, I had to agree with my taxonomist colleagues that it was indeed hard to get a purely taxonomic project, such as a complete catalog of species in some group, funded. It was easier to obtain funding instead for evolutionary biology, and later, genomics, of my butterflies than it was to fund an infrastructure project like taxonomy. For this reason, the project is now archived.
