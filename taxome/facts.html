  <br>
Dear Jim,<br>
  <br>
The Web version of Viadocs currently contains 99% (i.e. a total of 27,578)
of all published names for world pyraloid moths (i.e. Pyraloidea plus Alucitoidea,
Hyblaeoidea, Pterophoroidea, Simaethistoidea, Thyridoidea and Whalleyanoidea).<br>
  <br>
I am pretty confident that 95%+ of all published heliconiine names will be
present in the NHM's card index. Thus simply filling in the name, author
and date of publication fields will enable users to search for the card images
in the Viadocs database and then read off information such as the original
description reference. Also, if these 3 fields were filled in, it will enable
me to link the records in Viadocs to other databases and pull out data from
them which can then be used to populate Viadocs. I guess the main thing that
Gerardo might be concerned about is if we use his currently unpublished name
combinations and synonomies. However, if these were identifiable in his list
then we could avoid entering these data into Viadocs.<br>
  <br>

LEPINDEX COULD WELL BE THE LARGEST &nbsp;TAXONOMIC DATABASE IN THE WORLD<br>
The largest nomenclatural database of animal names I can find on the Web
is <a href="http://www.sel.barc.usda.gov/diptera/BIOSYS.HTM">The Diptera Site</a>, with 200,000 names - do you know of any larger database?
(GWB 2003).<br>
<br>
Possibly Markku Savela's "Life" list of the whole of life! &nbsp;(But he
doesn't give facts and figures, and his list is overtly "secondary", i.e.
culled from other sources. &nbsp;The butterflies for "Life" were taken from
D'Abrera's Butterflies of the World series, so represent what is in the NHM).<br>See <a href="http://www.nic.funet.fi/pub/sci/bio/life/">http://www.nic.funet.fi/pub/sci/bio/life/</a><br>
<br>
For completeness of a group, <a href="http://research.amnh.org/entomology/social_insects/">Antbase</a> or the <a href="http://viceroy.eeb.uconn.edu/Orthoptera">Orthoptera Species File </a>may be among the best. &nbsp;I am unclear how far <a href="http://www.fishbase.org/">FishBase</a> has got for completeness. &nbsp;Many other similar programs are shown in our "<a href="links.html">Links</a>" page.<br>

<br>
I believe that within 3-5 years I could compile a complete synonymical list<br>
for the butterflies of the world, in database format, including not only a<br>
list of all available names, but ALL names ever applied to butterflies.<br>
This is already done for the <b>Neotropical butterflies</b> (&gt;7579 "valid" species<br>
at the latest count, Lamas et al. in press). and partly done for the Australian and Afrotropical<br>
butterflies (in a less comprehensive format).&nbsp; There is a skeleton list for<br>
European species, and<b> Harish Gaonkar</b> is working on a list of the Indian<br>
species.&nbsp; Greatest needs are to compile exhaustive lists for the Holarctic<br>
(kind of a nightmare because of all the synonyms, forms, aberrations, etc.<br>
involved) and SE Asia.&nbsp; The<b> list of butterfly &amp; moth genera</b> compiled by the<br>
NHM is of tremendous help, but needs to be checked carefully (I know quite a<br>
number of errors and omissions in it).&nbsp; <b>Bridges'</b> compilations are also<br>
helpful, but he missed too many things and commited too many errors, as he<br>
did not have access to all the primary literature.&nbsp; Lastly, the <b>NHM card<br>
catalogue</b> is pretty good, but is certainly not complete (even through<br>
1980!).&nbsp; With enough funds and paid personnel, it should be relatively easy<br>
to incorporate into the core nomenclatural database digital images of the<br>
primary types held in european collections (where more than 3/4 of all<br>
extant types should be housed), and pdf's of the original descriptions.<br>
<br><b>
GERARDO LAMAS INFO RE: GBIF PREPROPOSAL</b><br>
Here in my office I'm sitting on three main sets of data which ought to go<br>
into the public domain some day:<br>
1. A virtually complete (from 1628 to the end of 2001) bibliography of the<br>
Neotropical butterflies, all currently in Word (not databased), backed by<br>
originals or photocopies of 99.9% of all references.<br>
2. A complete checklist of the Neotropical butterflies, fully synonymical,<br>
containing all genus group and species group names.&nbsp; The list is in<br>
WordPerfect (easily translatable into Word), but not databased.&nbsp; I'm NOT<br>
sole author of this list, as others involved are Mielke (Hesperiidae),<br>
Robbins (Eumaeini), Casagrande (Brassolini), Viloria &amp; Pyrcz (coauthors of<br>
Pronophilina), and Callaghan (first author of Riodinidae).&nbsp; Naturally, this<br>
list evolves daily, as new information or interpretation (or speculation)<br>
pours in.<br>
3. A collection of photographs (about 95% prints, 5% slides) of primary<br>
types (holotypes, lectotypes, neotypes, or at least one syntype) of ca. 75%<br>
of the names ever applied to Neotropical butterflies (this possibly<br>
represents over 90% of all curently existing types, the remainder are most<br>
probably lost).&nbsp; Quality of the photographs is quite variable, as they were<br>
not taken and developed under the same conditions, but all are potentially<br>
digitisable (and digitally enhanceable).<br>
<br>
Things I might do at the NHM (as a sort of "consultant"), provided enough<br>
time and resources were available:<br>
<br>
1. Search for and locate "missing" Neotropical types (my rough estimate is<br>
that some 200 Neotropical unrecognized types might still be found hidden in<br>
odd drawers). Set those types (and others?) aside for simultaneous/ulterior<br>
digitisation (by somebody else).<br>
2. Do the same for all non-Neotropical types of Riodinidae.<br>
3. Work towards completion of fully synonymical world checklists (in<br>
database format) of some groups; Riodinidae and Hesperiidae would probably<br>
be the easiest and fastest to complete, as they involve a relatively small<br>
number of names in the Holarctic and Oriental literature.<br>
4. Check the Viadocs database and (for Neotropical taxa) incorporate missing<br>
names, correct all spelling and dating errors and, as far as feasible,<br>
incorporate data on types (status, number, location, type-locality, etc.).<br>

<br>
Dear Jim<br>
<br>
Thanks for your email - I'm glad you like the site.&nbsp; I agree that George
has done an excellent job on the database, and I gather that it is considerably
more functional than the original conception, which if I understand correctly
was simply to get the data off the cards and into a single searchable field.&nbsp;
Obviously, there is no comparison between such a primitive system and the
fully-featured and flexible one which George has created.<br>
<br>
Regarding your questions about producing checklists or taxonomic lists, I
don't see any problem there.&nbsp; As long as the database is suitably structured
(and George's is fine) it ought to be possible to output the data in any
desired format or combination.&nbsp; Similarly, there should be no problem
in selecting only a subset of the data for output.<br>
<br>
DSML is a relatively limited (and therefore limiting) database management
system.&nbsp; As you say, it was developed at NHM, but its originator subsequently
left us, and although the concept is excellent, development has been patchy.&nbsp;
Chris Sleep (the man now responsible for mantaining and developing it) has
managed to develop it to some extent, but is hampered in this regard by his
many other responsibilities, so it is unlikely that DSML will ever become
much more that what it currently is (although it is more than adaquete for
producing formatted lists, and as you can see on the NHM site, it is possible
to produce classy output - but it could be easier!).&nbsp; There is so little
documentation for DSML, and it's so hard to understand, that I wouldn't recommend
it!<br>
<br>
That said, any of the other DBMS packages that are available (asp, jsp, cold
fusion, php) could be used to do the job, and in fact might do it better
(or easier).<br>
<br>
<blockquote>Would such systems be interoperable with others' querying systems?<br>
</blockquote>
<br>
I'm not uqite sure what you mean by the above.&nbsp; It's the database that
gets queried, and since almost all databases these days understand SQL, the
database could be queried by any number of systems.&nbsp; DSML, asp, jsp,
or whatever, simply acquire and format the data, usually via ODBC or similar.<br>
<br>
If you are talking about www applications, it really doesn't matter too much
which you use.&nbsp; The point is that the output must be comprehensible
by the user's browser.&nbsp; Since all server-side systems basically spit
out HTML, more-or-less any user can access the output over the web (for a
list or other simple output - the LepIndex site doesn't work well with version
3 browsers because of the javascript involved, but I wouldn't recommend anyone
to use so old a browser unless they had no choice).&nbsp; Similarly, if the
database became much larger, or it so many users were accessing it that performance
was adversly affected, it could be transferred into SQLserver (or a similar
dedicated db system) and still be queried by the same www scripts, probably
with only minor modifications.<br>
<br>
<blockquote>I imagine that such a query add-on would take a week or two of
additional programming, however it was set up (whether DSML or some sort
of open-source system such as Java).<br>
</blockquote>
<br>
Yes - that's probably about right.<br>
<br>
I hope the above is helpful.&nbsp; Please don't hesitate to contact me again for further info or clarification as necessary.<br>
<br>
Best wishes, Mike<br>

<hr width="100%" size="2">A QUICK GUIDE TO DATABASE MANAGEMENT<br>
<br> DBMS -- DataBase Management Systems: all of them, online and not
online, I guess. &nbsp;These are programs which obtain information from
databases, almost always these days via a standardized language, SQL.<br>
<br> ODBC -- Open Sources DataBase Connectivity, also called "Data
Sources" in Win2000+, a software-independent method of finding
information in databases. ODBC knows locations, etc. of databases, and
versions of SQL used by each database program. &nbsp;ODBC provides the
infrastructure that allows SQL queries between databases constructed by
different programs (e.g. Paradox, Access etc.).<br>
<br>
SQL -- Structured Query Language, standardized language used to probe or query databases for information.<br>
<br>
ASP &nbsp;-- Active Server Pages, an open source DBMS for WWW, like all those
below, spits out HTML "on the fly". &nbsp;Microsoft's version is called ASP.NET,
and they claim it is easier, more intuitive to write, etc. &nbsp;All "scripts"
code is visible, it is an interpreted language, unlike "Components", which
are compiled I guess.<br>
<br>
JSP -- JavaServer Pages. &nbsp;Java is a programming script language ?designed
with the web in mind. &nbsp;JSP uses Java Script to manage data queries in its DBMS function.<br>
<br>
coldfusion -- from MacroMedia: "Easily build Rich Internet Applications that integrate
                            with databases, XML, web services, Macromedia Flash,
                            and more." &nbsp;Another DBMS.<br>
<br>
PHP -- A DBMS which " is a widely-used general-purpose scripting language that is especially
suited for Web development and can be embedded into HTML." &nbsp;Initials
stand for "PHP: Hypertext     Preprocessor" (the inclusion of the initials
in the title is a typical open source programmer's joke). &nbsp;It is the
most popular of all Apache WebServer add-ons. &nbsp;Apache is also an open
source program. &nbsp;<br>
<br>
SQLServer -- DB program for the web which should allow faster download of information.<br>
