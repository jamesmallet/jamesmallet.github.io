<br><b><i><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font color="#006600">Butterflies
and taxonomy</font></font></i></b>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">There are about 17,500 described species
of butterflies (including skippers) worldwide (see "<a href="rhopnos.html">the
scale of the problem</a>", Ackery et al. 1999), compared with maybe 1,413,000
species of all organisms described (Wilson 1992). Nearly half of all butterflies
are estimated to be in the new world tropics (7,500 spp., see Heppner 1991,
Lamas 1997, Robbins &amp; Opler 1997, Lamas et al. submitted). Butterflies
represent around 1% of all species known.</font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">In the future, with most species of organisms
described, it is to be hoped that taxonomy - i.e. information related to
identification and descriptions of taxa, or nameable groups of individual
organisms - will be available free of charge for government, academic,
commercial and private use. This seems most in line with current taxonomic
practice (where all that is required is library access, and no patenting
of naturally-occurring organisms is allowed), and indeed with current practice
for another fundamental kind of information, genome sequences. The most
convenient system for presenting taxonomic information would be as an internationally-moderated
website (Godfray 2002a,b).</font>
</p><p><b><i><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font color="#006600">A modest proposal</font></font></i></b>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">We propose using butterflies to provide
a model "Taxome Project", a complete taxonomy, for a sizeable chunk of
fauna. The work would contain&nbsp; links to key genetic information of
use in phylogeny reconstruction, and, indeed, almost any other information
relevant to the taxon available on the word-wide web. An exemplar large-scale
complete taxomony is needed as a demonstration for all of taxonomy, in
a similar way that an example eukaryotic genome was provided by the genome
of <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i>.</font>
</p><p><b><i><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font color="#006600">Why butterflies?</font></font></i></b>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Butterflies are popular with the public,
roughly twice as diverse as birds (9,000 spp., Wilson 1992) or ants (11,000
spp., Clarke 2002), and are important in conservation issues; for instance,
in Britain, "Butterfly Conservation", the British conservation society,
is second in membership only to the Royal Society for the Protection of
Birds (RSPB).</font>
</p><p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Butterflies and moths are also among the
earliest examples and most important organisms for the understanding of
evolution, with the great discoveries in mimicry by Bates and M&uuml;ller
being followed rapidly by encyclopaedic analysis of sexual dimorphism and
sexual selection among butterlies by Charles Darwin.&nbsp; Today, a number of Lepidoptera, particularly butterflies, are <a href="modelcitations.html">model systems for evolution and ecology</a>. Genetically also,
they are important, and were the first organisms in which sex chromosomes
were discovered . Currently, there is a Lepidoptera Genome project focusing
particularly on the silkmoth, but including other Lepidoptera (Mita et
al. 2001), and a commercial collaboration to sequence the <i>Heliothis</i>
genome (Genoptera 2002). More recently, the call for proposals for funding
Bacterial Artificial Chromosome (BAC) libraries (NSF 2001) has
led to funding for a butterfly moth genomes, <i>Heliconius, Heliothis</i> and <i>Manduca,</i>
which happen to have particular developmental genetic interests (info gleaned
at Leiden butterfly conference; source reasonably reliable; final results
to be announced).</font>
</p><p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Butterflies, perhaps because they are mobile
exotherms, respond extremely rapidly to environmental disturbance or degradation,
especially those involving temperature changes, and are well studied ecologically.
In Europe, many butterflies have undergone well-documented extinctions
or range contractions, almost all of which due to changes in agricultural
practice and degradation of the environment (Thomas &amp; Lewington 1991).
Similarly, via an army of amateur recording enthusiasts, we know more about
the impact of global warming on the poleward and elevational expansions
and contractions of butterfly distributions than for any other organisms
on the planet (Parmesan 1996, Parmesan et al. 1999, Thomas et al. 2001).</font>
</p><p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Because Europe holds most of the historical
collections made especially during the days of empires and before their
decline, in particular in museums in London, Paris, and various cities
in Germany, a European effort is essential if historical information, particularly
information about historic type specimens and other historical data, is
to become generally accessible. This is not to belittle important partners,
which will include the USA, Russia, China and Japan, and indeed any country
or people with expertise or information on the topic of taxonomy. However,
Europe, with its long-established museums has perhaps most to offer to
the world community by organization of their museum resources, and a program
generated from within Europe would receive world-wide support.</font>
</p><p><b><i><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font color="#006600">The Taxome
Project: democratization and global dissemination of European scientific
resources</font></font></i></b>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Currently, the developing world criticises
countries with major museums for making the information hard to extract
for scientists in poorer countries with little access to libraries and
obscure taxonomic literature, even though many of the data and type specimens
may come from their own countries. The Taxome Project would to much to
democratise this information (i.e. "data repatriation").</font>
</p><p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">European countries have signed international
agreements on biodiversity which mandate that they should manage their
own natural resources, and also help provide other countries with information
which they hold to manage theirs. Central to this effort is taxonomy, the
identification and enumeration of subspecies, species and higher taxa,
without which any biodiversity management is impossible. The Taxome Project
aims to provide this information in an accessible, open format.</font>
</p><p><b><i><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font color="#006600">Rejuvenation
of taxonomy as science</font><font color="#ff0000"><font size="+2">**</font></font></font></i></b>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">There are likely to be many excellent
scientific uses of such large-scale taxonomic databases. General patterns
of evolution, speciation, and biogeography will emerge from such detailed
data.</font>
</p><p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">As an example, take species concepts. The
so-called "phylogenetic species concept", or diagnostic species concept
of Cracraft and others has been criticised in that it may lead to very
large numbers of species names being required compared with current counts
based on "polytypic" species. However, some of its practitioners argue
that the phylogenetic concept will inflate the numbers of species of birds
very little, and may only approximately double the numbers of "species"
considered valid from 9,000 to about 20,000 bird species (Zink 1996). A
guess based on Heliconiina would put the species inflation for the phylogenetic
concept between about 4-fold (the basal Heliconiina) to about 7-fold (<i>Heliconius</i>,
<i>Eueides</i>, and allies) (information from Brown 1979), but we won't
know until we have an accurate database on species and subspecies names
across a diverse phylogenetic group.</font>
</p><p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Of course, any study or commercial use
of biology involves identification and taxonomy. Gene databases, for instance,
rely on the information supplier's identifications, and&nbsp; errors of
identification of the taxonomic source of the sequence are likely to be
more problematic than errors with the sequence read-out itself. The identification
of organisms is so fundamental that it is not surprising it is one of the
earliest sciences (taxonomists, including lepidopterists John Ray and James
Petiver, along with Isaac Newton, were among the first generation of Fellows
of the Royal Society of London founded in 1662 - see Salmon 2000).&nbsp;
Taxonomy was the first bioinformatics. However, historical precedent is
no excuse for using an eighteenth-century means of information transfer
in the twenty-first century. We need efficient means of taxomomic information
retrieval now. The Taxome Project is long overdue.</font>
