<font face="Arial,Helvetica">Ian Wynne and I are collaborating with the
University of Leeds and Birmingham on ecology and genetics of speciation
in British butterflies.&nbsp; We concentrate on the brown argus / northern
brown argus (<i>Aricia agestis/artaxerxes</i>). In northern England
and Scotland <i>Aricia artaxerxes</i> is single-brooded (univoltine); in the
South, <i>Aricia agestis</i> is has two broods per year (bivoltine). These two
forms were traditionally regarded as subspecies, but are now treated as separate species.
They also have other genetic differences, including mitochondrial
DNA haplotype, which do not appear to correlate perfectly with voltinism (see map at left). We are investigating the factors keeping these two forms apart,
whether they still hybridize in nature, and how the voltinism (single-
versus double-brooded) correlates with genetic differences.
<p>We also work on metapopulation biology
of the silver studded blue (<i>Plebejus argus</i>) and other British insects.</font>
