<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Our overall objectives were to investigate
speciation by measuring the natural selection keeping compatible species
apart.&nbsp; This research is fundamental to an understanding of the origin
of species, and of the maintenance of biological diversity in general.&nbsp;
Because of our research, <i>Heliconius</i> has become an important model
system for speciation research.</font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">A pair of sister species were investigated:
<i>Heliconius
melpomene</i> and <i>Heliconius cydno</i>.&nbsp; These butterflies are
well studied ecologically and genetically, and, because they form part
of a rapidly radiating tropical group, are excellent model organisms for
studies of the ecology and genetics of speciation.&nbsp; These species
remain distinct although they overlap and hybridize occasionally throughout
the rainforests of Central America and western South America. We have answered
the following questions:</font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">1) <i>What is the genealogy of Heliconius
cydno, H. melpomene, and related species?</i> We have used nuclear and
mitochondrial DNA sequences to develop a well-supported phylogeny of the
group that disproves an earlier estimate.&nbsp; Between closely related
species that hybridize, such as cydno and melpomene, there is evidence
for “naturally occurring genetic modification”.&nbsp; In particular, the
mannose phosphate isomerase gene appears to have been transferred across
the species boundary relatively recently.</font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">2)<i> How does mating discrimination between
species evolve?</i>&nbsp; <i>Heliconius cydno</i> and <i>melpomene</i>
differ strongly in their colour pattern: they each belong to different
“mimicry rings” of butterflies that are unpalatable to birds.&nbsp; We
have shown for the first time that the evolution of mimicry is a major
cause of speciation, due to the effect of colour pattern mimicry on mating
discrimination.&nbsp; We have also demonstrated that the two species have
diverged more in mate recognition where they overlap than in non-overlapping
populations, a pattern expected if there has been adaptive evolution to
avoid deleterious hybridization (a process known as “reinforcement”).&nbsp;
Reinforcement has been shown previously only in a handful of convincing
cases.</font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">3) <i>What is the nature and strength of
selection against hybrids?</i>&nbsp; F1 hybrid females between the two
species are sterile, while all male hybrids are fertile.&nbsp; In butterflies,
the females are chromosomally&nbsp; heterogametic (WZ; equivalent to XY
males in humans, for example), and our result thus conforms to Haldane’s
Rule, named after JBS Haldane who first noted that the heterogametic sex
suffers more incompatibilities in crosses between species. To our surprise,
we have also uncovered F1 female hybrid sterility (in only one direction
of cross) between geographic populations within one of the species, <i>H.
melpomene</i>.&nbsp; Both male and female hybrids between <i>cydno</i>
and <i>melpomene</i> suffer in sexual selection: they are discriminated
against by individuals of both species.&nbsp; We are currently performing
field and laboratory studies to measure predator selection against hybrids
due to colour pattern, which is non-mimetic in hybrids.</font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">4) <i>Where do species differences map
in the Heliconius genome?</i>&nbsp; We have shown that Haldane’s Rule sterility
of hybrid females maps to the sex (Z-) chromosome, a result which supports
the Muller/Turelli/Orr “dominance theory” of Haldane’s Rule.&nbsp; We are
developing a genome map of <i>Heliconius</i> which will enable genomic
studies of colour pattern loci, sterility genes, loci involved in mate
choice, and ecological traits involved in speciation.</font>
