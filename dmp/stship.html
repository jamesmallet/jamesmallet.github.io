<hr size=3></font></i></b><font size=-1>Enthusiastic, talented and adventurous
students with strong interests in evolution, genetics, or ecology are invited
to apply for this studentship on evolution in tropical butterflies.&nbsp;
The work will involve a mixture of fieldwork in South and Central American
rainforests, molecular genetics, and data analysis.&nbsp; I am seeking
an independent-minded candidate who will fit in with our research group
and collaborators in Panama, the Natural History Museum, and elsewhere.
The precise project depends on the particular student's interests and strengths,
but will be among the following:</font></font></font>

<i>Molecular
phylogeny of Oleria</i></font></font></font></b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font color="#C0C0C0"><font size=-1>.&nbsp;
Many taxa have been described in this genus of small, mimetic, often transparent
butterflies (Ithomiinae, see background) of the rainforest understory.
However, very little is known about the biology or systematics of <i>Oleria</i>;
it remains unclear exactly how many species exist (probably around 40).&nbsp;
Diversity in the genus peaks in the Andes and nearby Amazonian lowlands
of Ecuador and Peru.&nbsp; There is also a high degree of local differentiation
into racial or semi-species forms, making <i>Oleria</i> an excellent model
system for studying speciation. The project would involve fieldwork and
and analysis of DNA sequences to establish relationships between the taxa.&nbsp;
The research complements that of Dr. Keith Willmott, who will be working
on species delimitation and morphological systematics of <i>Oleria</i>,
funded by a Leverhulme grant.&nbsp; Dr. Willmott will work in Ecuador and
at the London Natural History Museum for 3 years from 2001. We propose
to use comparative methods to test Bates' (1862) theory that shifts in
mimicry can result in speciation. If colour patterns used in mimicry also
act as mating cues (see below), mimetic butterflies may provide an example
where ecological adaptations promote speciation.</font></font></font><font color="#C0C0C0"></font>

<i>Mimicry
and speciation in Heliconius</i></font></font></font></b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font color="#C0C0C0"><font size=-1>.&nbsp;
Our group is investigating a pair of Panamanian sister species, <i>Heliconius
cydno</i> and <i>H. melpomene</i>.&nbsp; The two species differ in their
colour pattern due to M&uuml;llerian mimicry, and we have shown that colour
is also important in mate recognition (Jiggins et al., Nature, in press).</font></font></font></td>

<td><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font color="#C0C0C0"><font size=-1>Mating
behaviour between the species in sympatry is more choosy than between allopatric
populations, suggesting that speciation&nbsp; has occurred by "reinforcement",
but we need more experimental work from various allopatric and sympatric
populations to test whether this effect is general.&nbsp; The species occasionally
hybridize in nature, and we will carry out field experiments to test whether
the hybrid colour patterns are selected against because of a lack of mimciry.
Finally, laboratory hybrids between the species produce fertile males and
sterile females; to our surprise, we also find unisexual sterility and
non-random mating between Guiana and Panama races of one of the species,
<i>H.
melpomene</i>.&nbsp; Further work is required to find the contact zone,
probably in Venezuela between the two semisterile groups of <i>H. melpomene</i>.
The student would join an interdisciplinary team, including Dr. Chris Jiggins,
Dr. Biff Bermingham at STRI, Panama, and another UCL student, Vanessa Bull,
currently based at STRI.</font></font></font><font color="#C0C0C0"></font>

<i>Biogeography
of the foothills of the Andes</i></font></font></font></b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font color="#C0C0C0"><font size=-1>.&nbsp;
The worlds' greatest diversity in plants, insects, and birds is found in
the rainforests of the Eastern foothills of the Andes. The steep ecological
gradients with altitude, temperature and humidity in this region mean that
many closely related taxa meet, overlap, and sometimes hybridize. To what
extent can the history of the biota be deduced from today's complex patterns
of distribution?&nbsp; The student will study the distribution and genetics
of <i>Heliconius</i> and/or Ithomiinae to examine these questions in NE
Peru and Ecuador.</font></font></font></td>
