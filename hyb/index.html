<p><br>
  <font face="Arial,Helvetica">One of the best ways of showing evolutionary continuity 
  between species and geographic races is to demonstrate that hybridization still 
  occurs between closely related species. In Victorian times and early this century, 
  naturalists were very interested, like "stamp-collectors", in freaks of nature, 
  including rare hybrids between species. Between the 1930s and about 1980, there 
  was decreased interest about the peculiarities of nature, and increased emphasis 
  on the "fundamental" biological "realities" of animal species. (Hybridization 
  between plant species is so abundant and easily shown, of course, that this 
  rather myopic view of "pure", "good" species has never really caught on among 
  botanists). Widely used field guides from this period often omit pictures even 
  of common hybrids of birds and butterflies that can be seen in the wild, while 
  treating much rarer or even extinct species in the same book. Recently, however, 
  there has been renewed interest in all aspects of biodiversity, including that 
  within species, and it is possible to discern a return of interest in variants, 
  hybrids, and exceptions ("bad species") as well as the good species. In some 
  beautiful recent books, often thorough world treatments of particular groups 
  of butterflies and birds, hybridization between species is again becoming well-documented.</font> 
</p>

<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">There has also been an impressive amount of recent 
  work on hybrid zones, but most of this work has concentrated, perhaps for obvious 
  reasons, on zones where hybrids are easily obtained, such as the <a href="pw/pw1.html">hybrid 
  zone between races of <i>Heliconius melpomene</i></a> in Eastern Ecuador (see 
  also <a href="http://www.ucl.ac.uk/taxome/jim/Mim/Bates63_2.html">Henry Walter 
  Bates' (1863)</a> pioneering work on natural hybridization in <em>Heliconius</em>, 
  and <a href="http://www.ucl.ac.uk/taxome/lit/beebe55.pdf">William Beebe's (1955)</a> 
  first experimental crosses; these are now considered to be hybridization between 
  geographic races of the same species). Arguably, these studies contribute little 
  to understanding speciation (JM criticises himself here ... and hybrid zone 
  studies are interesting for other reasons!), because the forms that interact 
  have clearly <i>not</i> speciated. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Hybrids between species are much rarer: usually 
  less than one in a thousand individuals in a pair of hybridizing species are 
  recognizable hybrids, and often even fewer. What is not generally realized, 
  however, is that <a href="http://www.ucl.ac.uk/taxome/jim/pap/mallethyb05.pdf">the 
  fraction of all species that hybridize is high</a> (Mallet 2005). A world-wide 
  survey of birds has shown that around 9% of species hybridize (Panov in Grant 
  &amp; Grant 1992), and in European butterflies including Hesperiidae, the rate 
  is about 12% of species (Guillaumin &amp; Descimon 1976) - here species are 
  classified conservatively using the polytypic species concept, not the so-called 
  "phylogenetic concept", so hybridization between geographic forms is not considered 
  as interspecific hybridization, unless hybrids are very rare in the zone of 
  overlap. Some genera and higher groups have much higher rates, over 20% of species, 
  for example in the American warblers, the birds of paradise, and Darwin's finches 
  among the birds (Grant &amp; Grant 1992). See also Mallet (2005) for a review 
  of natural hybridization in animals which surveys a number of groups, including 
  birds, mammals, as well as insects, and compares them to hybridization rates 
  in plants.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">A somewhat related topic is the topic of hybrid 
  speciation. The speciation of taxa due to hybridization requires, of course, 
  the existence of ongoing natural hybridization documented here. Recent publications 
  provide conclusive evidence that at least one of the Heliconiina, <em>Heliconius 
  heurippa</em>, is a hybrid species, having characteristics inherited from the 
  local races of both <em>Heliconius cydno</em> and <em>H. melpomene</em> (Salazar 
  et al. 2005, Mav&aacute;rez et al. 2006).</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">We here provide an updated database of <a href="hybtab.html">wild-caught 
  interspecific <i>Heliconius</i> hybrids</a>. In this butterfly genus, about 
  26% of species are known to hybridize (Mallet et al. 1998, Mallet 2005).</font> 
</p>


<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">For many of these species, <a href="artif/artifhyb.html">laboratory 
  hybrids have now been produced</a>.&nbsp; We have excluded any laboratory hybrids 
  from the database because we were interested here mainly in the potential for 
  natural hybrids.&nbsp; However, the artificially produced hybrids are a useful 
  confirmation of the hybrid status of the wild-caught individuals. Several recent 
  studies have dealt with laboratory hybridization, the inheritance of colour 
  pattern, and hybrid viability and sterility between <span style="font-style: italic;">Heliconius</span> 
  species (</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Jiggins &amp; McMillan 1997, McMillan 
  et al. 1997, Naisbit et. al. 2002, 2003).&nbsp; Gynandromorphs, presumably a 
  result of chimaeric development of separately fertilized zygotes, are relatively 
  common in<span style="font-style: italic;"> </span>hybridization experiments 
  between geographic races of </font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"> <span style="font-style: italic;">Heliconius</span> 
  species.&nbsp; This may merely be due to the greater ease of detection of gynandromorphs 
  in populations polymorphic for major colour pattern differences.&nbsp;</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"> 
  Larry Gilbert (pers. comm.) obtained an interesting <a href="artif/gynander.html">gyndandromorph 
  <span style="font-style: italic;">Heliconius cydno</span> x <span style="font-style: italic;">H. 
  melpomene</span></a> hybrid, perhaps the only one of its kind.</font></p>


<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Several specimens are unique and may be simple 
  mutational variants, as opposed to hybrids.&nbsp; These have been excluded from 
  our database as far as possible; for example, we here show a <a href="artif/edias_not.html">very 
  odd <i>Eueides</i></a> caught in the wild, and <a href="artif/ce.html">an aberrant 
  <span style="font-style: italic;">Heliconius charithonia</span></a> produced 
  in an insectary. Other probable mutant specimens are shown <a href="mutants/mutants.html">here</a>.</font></p>


<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Between most pairs of species, hybrids
are very rare in nature. The only exceptions are <i>H. himera</i> and <i>H.
erato</i>, which hybridize wherever their ranges abut in contact zones.
In this pair of species, there is no inviability or sterility among the
hybrids, backcrosses, or F<sub>2</sub> (McMillan et al. 1997). The species remain
distinct because of mate choice (which is about 5% "leaky"), and strong
ecological selection against hybrids.</font> </p>


<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">In another good example, <i>Heliconius melpomene</i> 
  and <i>H. cydno</i> hybridize regularly (though at low frequency, maybe 1/1000 
  individuals are hybrids) throughout their joint range, and their distributions 
  overlap extensively throughout W. Ecuador, Andean Colombia and Venezuela, and 
  Central America. Here female hybrids have been found in the laboratory to be 
  sterile (Naisbit et. al. 2002, 2003), but wild hybrids are often backcross phenotypes, 
  showing that males backcross in the wild as well as in captivity. Once hybrids 
  have been produced in a local population, backcross phenotypes may survive at 
  high frequency for several generations. In <a href="mavarez/cristobaltab.html">a 
  collection of 103 <i>H. cydno</i> and <i>H. melpomene</i></a> made by Jes&uacute;s 
  Mav&aacute;rez in the botanic garden of San Cristobal, T&aacute;chira, Venezuela</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica">, 
  seven were putative backcross hybrids, even though such hybrids are rare elsewhere. 
  These two species are extremely closely related genetically, and the rarity 
  of hybrids is due to very strong mate discrimination (Jiggins et al. 2001). 
  Some mtDNA studies put <i>H. cydno</i> within the genealogy of <i>H. melpomene</i>; 
  i.e. <i>H. cydno</i> is little more than a clade of <i>Heliconius melpomene</i> 
  that has speciated,suggesting <i>H. melpomene</i> a paraphyletic remnant (Brower 
  1996).</font> </p>


<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">An important conclusion that can be
drawn from this kind of data is that speciation doesn't suddenly lead
to a complete absence of gene flow. There may be several millions of
years after speciation during which genes may be exchanged between
newly-evolved, recognizably and ecologically distinct species. Given
that new species are able to maintain genetic differences in spite of
hybridization, interspecific gene flow between animal species could be
quite common, and may even contribute to heritability and genetic
variation within animal species, as has been shown for the Darwin's
finches by Grant &amp; Grant (1992). There is very clear evidence in
the specimens we illustrate that wild hybrids between <i>H. melpomene</i>
and <i>H. cydno</i>, and between <i>H. erato</i> and <i>H. himera</i>,
backcross regularly. We are currently undertaking studies to
investigate whether significant gene flow occurs in some parts of the
genome between <i>Heliconius melpomene</i> and <i>H. cydno</i>, while
leaving other parts of the genome, affecting ecological and colour
pattern differences, intact.</font> </p>


<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Another conclusion is that reinforcement (adaptive 
  evolution of mate choice) may be more likely than previously realized. Reinforcement 
  is often seen as unlikely because the evolution of mating isolation has to race 
  against the breakdown of the genetic differences due to hybridization - the 
  latter will usually win. But, given that newly emerged species can stably maintain 
  their genetic differences in the face of gene flow, further mate choice should 
  be able to evolve adaptively to prevent the production of genetically inferior 
  hybrids.</font> </p>
