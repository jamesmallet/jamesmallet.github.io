Peru erato genetics.
4 May 2004

I was intrigued by something Chris said on 28 April:
"so that
means that the hypothesis proposed in Jiggins & McMillan
1997 (see fig 2) - that all amazonian erato races are
fixed for a himera-like allele at Cr is supported,
because you do not see segregation of Cr in your
himera x etylus broods".

In spite of the fact he did this genetics in my lab,
I have never tested this theory with my own data from
Peru in 1986-1987 (see Mallet,J 1989: The genetics of
warning colour in Peruvian hybrid zones
of _Heliconius erato_ and _H. melpomene_. Proc. Roy.
Soc. Lond. B 236, 163-185).  Here I go back to test
whether Cr (which is segregating as yellow hw bar) can
explain (a) black invasion of yellow fw band in DRy/DRy
homozygotes, (b) yellow invasion of red forewing bands
in DRy/d heterozygotes, and (c) I also looked at the
effect on yellow basal forewing spots, which is associated
with the Amazonian race, and correlates with yellow body
colour.

The results are given in the accompanying file:

http://www.ucl.ac.uk/taxome/hyb/FGBlum/peru_erato_genetics.xls.

Here, I show the results from the only broods
that have a bearing on the hypothesis
that the same interactions as in
himera x etylus crosses also explain the
favorinus (postman) x emma (Amazonian) in
the Peru hybrid zone.

I think you can see from the data
why I did not think of the hypothesis!

Firstly, I had few broods that were
informative (in particular, female informative
double heterozygotes are needed for Cr and for presence
of yellow in the forewing; and since the trait is
variably present, it doesn't really show up that often
in the right arrangements).  This is as true for
red/yellow invasion as for yellow/black invasion.
Yellow basal spots are also variable.

Secondly, whereas the hypothesis explains
some of the data in PE9, PE15, and PE28, it doesn't
explain the lack of yellow invasion in PE21 and PE27.
As you can see, most of the yellow expression is
explained by (a) brood-to-brood variability unrelated
to Cr, and by (b) DRy genotype.

However, it is clear that Cr has some explanatory value,
even in these crosses.  See especially PE15, in which
a *somewhat* informative Aconitase polymorphism is
co-segregating. It appears that there are "strong"
and "weak" Cr alleles, if you like (? more or fewer
transcription factor binding sites???!! --though
this may be to do with the genetic background on which
Cr is acting).

Another intriguing factor is that the Cr locus seems to
be affecting the presence of the yellow basal spot in the
forewing.  This is a characteristic of the Amazonian race
which is variably polymorphic elsewhere.  I have scored it
as absent (-), trace (+) and strong (++).  The yellow
spot is much better developed in Mike Blum's French Guiana
hybrid zone, where it is clearly segregating independently
of DRy and Sd.

The yellow line colour pattern found in SE Brazil might be
thought to be an analogue of this yellow spot in Amazonia,
but that is supposed to be tightly linked to Sd; it is
gene Yl.  However, there may be a similar interaction here;
I wonder if anyone has tested.

Anyway, thought I ought to clue you in on what I found.  It
is certainly suggestive.

Chris,

Yes, call this is the cr <lowercase> recessive allele
that produces yellow hw bar (from the postman race):

If you like -- the way I see it!--, the Cr allele from
Amazonia variably ADDS yellow expression (I of course
believe it to be derived in erato!) to the forewing in
red heterozygotes only (on the whole -- PE15#32, which
is d/d is the very unusual exception) to produce
red-yellow overprinting; it can do this both as
heterozygotes Cr/cr (e.g. PE15, PE28), and as homozygous
Cr/Cr (e.g. PE27, PE28).

Meanwhile, cr variably SUBTRACTS yellow from the
forewing band, only in DRy/DRy homozygotes.  And it can
do this both as heterozygote Cr/cr or as homozygote
cr/cr (PE9).

In your Jiggins & McMillan 1997 himera hypothesis --
you only argue for overprinting when you have Crhi/Crhi
Dhi/Dcyr genotypes, but I clearly remember it happening
in some of your F1 broods, as here.

Similarly, you argue that you can tell apart the black
forewings when you have Dhi/Dhi Cr-cyr/Cr-cyr homozygotes,
from black scale invasion in Dhi/Dhi Cr-hi/Cr-cyr
heterozygotes, and from full yellow fw expression in
Dhi/Dhi Cr-hi/Cr-hi homozygotes.  You are therefore
probably going to misscore your ((cyrxhimF1) x himera)
backcrosses for Cr; and, er.... funnily enough I am now
reviewing this for Heredity!

However, do you not think it is true that you cannot
misscore D heterozygotes in these himera backcross broods,
since you are always going to see red in the forewing if
it is a het?  So there is no reason, to my mind, why you
would get this effect of D pushing out to the end of the
chromosome in your mapping brood because of epistasis,
as you suggest in some places in the ms.

If you view yellow forewing expression as an effect of
the Cr locus, then you have to say it has variable
expression.  If you view it as a function of DRy, which
it clearly is to some extent, then DRy has a variable
effect on yellow expression.

In any case, I agree that the Cr expression in Amazonia
is similar to that in your himera/cyrbia crosses.  Is it
any more variable, though?  I doubt it.

Incidentally, I wonder whether you could score band shape
in the cyrbia backcross; but probably just not in the
(cyrxhim)x himera backcross -- it would be interesting to
see if it were linked to the same Sd gene found in the
himera x etylus crosses!

All the best, Jim
