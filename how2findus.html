<h1> <font color="green" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">How to find Jim or
  anyone else in the Galton Laboratory, Wolfson House, UCL</font> </h1>
<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Jim is in Room 412, Wolfson House. The
street address is 4 Stephenson Way, shown in square R-11 at the top of <a href="http://www.ucl.ac.uk/images/map_arounducl_l.jpg">
the UCL area map</a>, or at the right bottom corner of the top left grid on <a href=http://www.streetmap.co.uk/newmap.srf?x=529750&y=182250&z=1&sv=529750,182250&st=4&ar=N&ax=529454&ay=182525>
this London street map</a>.  Stephenson Way is abbreviated on the latter map to "STEPH. WAY", and the small building marked "UCL"
is Wolfson House. (The major part of the college is between Gower Street
and Gordon Street in the central part of each map.)
<h3>Closest Underground (Tube) Stations:</h3>
</font>
<ul>
  <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">From <b>Euston Square tube station</b>
    (Metropolitan &amp; Circle Lines), leave by the north exit (the sign says
    Euston and British Rail). Turn right into North Gower Street and turn right
    again into Stephenson Way, which is a partially cobbled L-shaped street. Wolfson
    House is on the inside corner of the L. <br>
    </font></li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">From <b>Euston Station</b> (British
    Rail, but also the tube: Northern Line, Victoria Line). There are many exits
    from the main hall of the station (to the West, East, and South), but you
    must take the West exit (Melton Street), walk through the colonnade, across
    Melton Street, and keep on going into Euston Street. Stephenson Way is first
    left off Euston Street. </font></li>
</ul>
<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Both stations are 2-5 minutes walk
from Wolfson House. If you have been walking for more than 10 minutes, you are
lost! Other stations such as King's Cross and Warren Street are also within walking
distance; see the London Street map for details.</font>
<h3><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">From airports:</font></h3>
<ul>
  <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Heathrow</b>. Take the Underground
    (Piccadilly line, dark blue) to central London and transfer to Victoria (pale
    blue) or Northern (black) lines to arrive at Euston. If you intend to travel
    on the underground later in the day and if you arrive after 9:30am, you might
    buy a one-day travel card. The trip from Heathrow airport to central London
    takes about one hour.</font> <br>
    <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><br>
    Alternatively take Heathrow Express train (15 minutes, every 15 minutes) to
    Paddington and then underground (Central or Hammersmith lines) to Euston Square.
    More expensive.</font><br>
  </li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Gatwick</b>. There are buses
    and trains to Victoria station. It takes about 30 minutes from Gatwick to
    Victoria by Gatwick Express or British Rail, then it's about 15 minutes to
    Euston Station, near the Galton Laboratory.</font></li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Luton</b>. The train to St
    Pancras is about 30 minutes. You can then take the Underground to Euston,
    or walk along Euston Road for about 10 minutes.</font>
